From that, I looked deeper into the product and realised how difficult it was to see the code path.</p><p>It used so many interfaces and abstract layers, that trying to understand where things began and ended was quite difficult. It got me thinking about the times I had looked at past projects (before I was so aware of clean code principles) and found it extremely difficult to get around in the project, mainly because my code navigation tools would always land me at an interface. It would take a lot of extra effort to find the concrete implementation or where something was wired up in some plugin type architecture.</p><p>I know some developers strictly turn down dependency injection containers for this very reason. It confuses the path of the software so much that the difficulty of code navigation is exponentially increased.</p><p>My question is: when a framework or pattern introduces so much overhead like this, is it worth it? Is it a symptom of a poorly implemented pattern?</p><p>I guess a developer should look to the bigger picture of what that abstractions brings to the project to help them get through the frustration. Usually though, it&#39;s difficult to make them see that big picture. I know I&#39;ve failed to sell the needs of IOC and DI with TDD. For those developers, use of those tools just cramps code readability far too much.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>This is really more of a long comment on @kevin cline&#39;s answer.</p><p>Even though the languages themselves don&#39;t necessarily cause or prevent this, I think there&#39;s something to his notion that it&#39;s related to languages (or at least language communities) to some degree anyway. In particular, even though you can run into sort of the same problem in different languages, it&#39;ll often take rather different forms in different languages.</p><p>Just for example, when you run into this in C++, chances are that it&#39;s a less a result of too much abstraction, and more a result of too much cleverness. Just for example, the programmer has hidden the crucial transformation that&#39;s happening (that you can&#39;t find) in a special iterator, so what looks like it&#39;s just copying data from one place to another really has a number of side effects that have nothing to do with that copying of the data. Just to keep things interesting, this is interleaved with output that&#39;s created as a side effect of creating a temporary object in the course of casting one type of object to another.</p><p>By contrast, when you run into it in Java, you&#39;re much more likely to be seeing some variant of the well known &#34;enterprise hello world&#34;, where instead of a single trivial class that does something simple, you get an abstract base class and a concrete derived class that implements interface X, and is created by a factory class in a DI framework, etc. The 10 lines of code that do the real work are buried under 5000 lines of infrastructure.</p><p>Some of it depends on the environment at least as much as the language -- working directly with windowing environments like X11 and MS Windows is notorious for turning a trivial &#34;hello world&#34; program into 300+ lines of nearly indecipherable garbage. Over time, we&#39;ve developed various toolkits to insulate us from that as well -- but 1) those toolkits are quite non-trivial themselves, and 2) the end result is still not only bigger and more complex, but also usually less flexible than a text-mode equivalent (e.g., even though it&#39;s just printing out some text, redirecting it to a file is rarely possible/supported).</p><p>To answer (at least part of) the original question: at least when I&#39;ve seen it, it was less a matter of a poor implementation of a pattern than of simply applying a pattern that was inappropriate to the task at hand -- most often of attempting to apply some pattern that might well be useful in a program that&#39;s unavoidably huge and complex, but when applied to a smaller problem ends up making it huge and complex as well, even though in this case the size and complexity really was avoidable.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
