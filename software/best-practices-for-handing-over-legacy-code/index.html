To prepare, I have already ordered Michael Feathers&#39; <em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em>.</p><p>But this books as well as most questions on legacy code I found so far are concerned with the case of inheriting code as-is. But in this case I actually have access to the original developer and we do have some time for an orderly hand-over.</p><p>Some background on the piece of code I will be inheriting:</p><ul><li><strong>It&#39;s functioning:</strong> There are no known bugs, but as performance requirements keep going up, some optimizations will become necessary in the not too distant future.</li><li><strong>Undocumented:</strong> There is pretty much zero documentation at the method and class level. What the code is supposed to do at a higher level, though, is well-understood, because I have been writing against its API (as a black-box) for years.</li><li><strong>Only higher-level integration tests:</strong> There are only integration tests testing proper interaction with other components via the API (again, black-box).</li><li><strong>Very low-level, optimized for speed:</strong> Because this code is central to an entire system of applications, a lot of it has been optimized several times over the years and is extremely low-level (one part has its own memory manager for certain structs/records).</li><li><strong>Concurrent and lock-free:</strong> While I am very familiar with concurrent and lock-free programming and have actually contributed a few pieces to this code, this adds another layer of complexity.</li><li><strong>Large codebase:</strong> This particular project is more than ten thousand lines of code, so there is no way I will be able to have everything explained to me.</li><li><strong>Written in Delphi:</strong> I&#39;m just going to put this out there, although I don&#39;t believe the language to be germane to the question, as I believe this type of problem to be language-agnostic.</li></ul><p>I was wondering how the time until his departure would best be spent. Here are a couple of ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Get everything to build on my machine:</strong> Even though everything should be checked into source code control, who hasn&#39;t forgotten to check in a file once in a while, so this should probably be the first order of business.</li><li><strong>More tests:</strong> While I would like more class-level unit tests so that when I will be making changes, any bugs I introduce can be caught early on, the code as it is now is not testable (huge classes, long methods, too many mutual dependencies).</li><li><strong>What to document:</strong> I think for starters it would be best to focus documentation on those areas in the code that would otherwise be difficult to understand e.g. because of their low-level/highly optimized nature. I am afraid there are a couple of things in there that might look ugly and in need of refactoring/rewriting, but are actually optimizations that have been out in there for a good reason that I might miss (cf. Joel Spolsky, <em><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" rel="noreferrer">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</a></em>)</li><li><strong>How to document:</strong> I think some class diagrams of the architecture and sequence diagrams of critical functions accompanied by some prose would be best.</li><li><strong>Who to document:</strong> I was wondering what would be better, to have him write the documentation or have him explain it to me, so I can write the documentation. I am afraid, that things that are obvious to him but not me would otherwise not be covered properly.</li><li><strong>Refactoring using pair-programming:</strong> This might not be possible to do due to time constraints, but maybe I could refactor some of his code to make it more maintainable while he was still around to provide input on why things are the way they are.</li></ul><p>Please comment on and add to this. Since there isn&#39;t enough time to do all of this, I am particularly interested in how you would prioritize.</p><p><em>Update:</em> As the hand-over project is over I have expanded this list with my own experiences in <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/132887/40190">this answer below</a>.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>As you have access to the developer you code ask:-</p><ul><li><p>Which modules were the most difficult to code/implement. What were the problems and how were they overcome.</p></li><li><p>Which modules have generated the most bugs.</p></li><li><p>Which modules have resulted in the most difficult to solve bugs.</p></li><li><p>Which bits of code he is most proud off.</p></li><li><p>Which bits of code he would really like to refactor, but, has not had the time.</p></li></ul><p>These questions will give you an insight into whats going to cause you the most problems, and, perhaps more importantly a handle on the thought processes and perspectives original developer.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
