This unfortunately means there is commonly a 30/70 split of Programming tasks to &#34;other technical work&#34;. This work includes:</p><ul><li>Working with DBA / Unix / Network / Loadbalancer teams on various tasks</li><li>Placing and managing orders for hardware or infrastructure in different regions</li><li>Running tests that have not yet been migrated to CI</li><li>Analysis</li><li>Support / Investigation</li></ul><p>Its fair to say that the Developers would all prefer to be coding, rather than doing these more mundane tasks, so I try to hand out the fun programming jobs evenly amongst the team.</p><p>Most of the team was hired because, though they may not have the elite programming skills to write their own compiler / game engine / high-frequency trading system etc., they are good communicators who &#34;can get stuff done&#34;, work with other teams, and somewhat navigate the complex bureaucracy here. They are good developers, but they are also good all-round technical staff.</p><p>However, one member of the team probably has above-average coding skills, but below-average communication skills. Traditionally, the previous Development Manager tended to give him the Programming tasks and not the more mundane tasks listed above. However, I don&#39;t feel that this is fair to the rest of the team, who have shown an aptitude for developing a well-rounded skillset that is commonly required in a big-business IT department.</p><p>What should I do in this situation? If I continue to give him more programming work, I know that it will be done faster (and conversely, I would expect him to complete the other work slower). But it goes against my principles, and promotes the idea that you can carve out a &#34;comfortable niche&#34; for yourself simply by being bad at the tasks you don&#39;t like.</p><p>I want to clarify that I&#39;m not trying to address this issue due to a grudge, or that I have a &#34;chip on my shoulder&#34; as was mentioned. I&#39;m looking for advice on how to keep a well-rounded team, which is happy and motivated. By observing the variety of answers to this question, it seems like there are a lot of different opinions on how to achieve this.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>It sounds like you are placing too much effort on having well rounded <em>individuals</em> and not enough effort on having a well rounded <em>team</em>.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with being good at something--in fact, that is probably why he was hired! You should be thankful to have someone who is good at programming to begin with.</p><p>You stated:</p><blockquote><p>... it goes against my principles, and promotes the idea that you can

He&#39;s not being bad at the other tasks to get out of them--he&#39;s merely focused his efforts on becoming a better programmer. There is nothing wrong with that.</p><p>As a manager, it is not your job to make sure that everyone is &#34;well rounded&#34;. It is your job to make sure that s*** gets done. And you&#39;re not doing that. In fact, you&#39;re making decisions that are <em>stopping</em> things from getting done.</p><p>Whatever problem you have, you need to get over it--you are making your team less productive.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
