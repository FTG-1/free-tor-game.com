While that other question was deemed localized, I believe the underlying problem is something that is extremely common in our industry. I know there are some developers, who will read this and think I&#39;m making this stuff up and then they might reply how everyone cares about their work and wants to learn, but just looking at other Programmers SE posts (<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3282/whats-the-scariest-piece-of-other-peoples-code-youve-ever-had-to-maintain">case in point</a>), I know that&#39;s not universally true.</p><p>So let&#39;s say you have someone on your team (or maybe majority) who&#39;s standard operating procedure is to copy/paste and who believes that everything can be solved if only you add enough function calls and variables. This person never heard of TDD, DRY or SOLID and outside of 40 hours at work when they are busy working, they never once read a single methodology/pratices/design book.</p><p>In the past I (and others) have asked, <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/96590/best-way-to-introduce-oop-ood-to-team-of-experienced-c-engineers">how to do you teach OOD</a>. But now I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s not the right question. The real question is how do you approach such a person/team and make them curious about better way of doing things? How do you inspire them to learn?  Without that, it seems that all the teaching, meetings, lectures, discussions are useless if they are perfectly happy going back to their desk and doing what they&#39;ve always done.</p><p>I work with a bunch of people like that. They are actually quite bright individuals, but I hate when I hear, &#34;I&#39;m done coding, just need to refactor and split into multiple classes to make DXM happy&#34;. They don&#39;t refactor for cleaner, readable, maintainable code, but only because otherwise they&#39;ll get scolded. I know they are capable of learning, just seems that there&#39;s a general lack of motivation.</p><p>When I deliver work, it generally has way fewer bugs and the work I owned never became 5000-line monstrosity of a class. Other&#39;s would make comments like, &#34;your code is much cleaner and readable than our stuff&#34;, so they see the difference.  But at the same time, I feel like they believe they get paid for 40 hours regardless of what they do, so they actually don&#39;t mind if they spend 3 full days in QA looking for a bug that shouldn&#39;t have been introduced in the first place. Or that they take a week to modify one class because there are so many dependencies they end up touching.  The though, &#34;maybe that class should have been written differently&#34; never seems to pop up.</p><p>Can anything be done in these situations? Has anyone succeeded? Or is it best to isolate such mindset to non-critical parts of the project and minimize the damage?</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When I say &#34;lack of motivation&#34;. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s lack of motivation to work or do a good job because they simply stopped caring.  Most of our team is actually quite the opposite. They definitely care about the product. We have guys that will work nights and weekends. The part I&#39;m trying to get through is with improved habits and skills, they actually wouldn&#39;t have to work as much. I guess that &#34;40 hours&#34; thing made this post sound a little too negative.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>You found yourself the reason: &#34;I know they are capable of learning, just seems that there&#39;s a general lack of motivation.&#34;</p><p>There are people who are passionate about their work. And there are others who, being sometimes competent enough, are <strong>working just for money</strong>. <strong>They know their stuff, but they don&#39;t enjoy their work.</strong> They will not spend extra time doing additional refactoring to make code readable or solving an intriguing problem when a quick and ugly hack can do the job.</p><p>This phenomenon exists in every job. It&#39;s just that some jobs are not extremely exciting (have you seen an accountant who loves his job and dreamed about it already when he was a child?), but in programming, there are plenty of people who really love what they are doing (otherwise Programmers.SE will be pretty empty). This means that as passionate developers, who talk daily to other passionate developers, we have more chances to be surprised seeing a person who does programming just for money.</p><p>What can we do? Not too much. In all cases, it&#39;s not to you, but to the human resources to choose people who are truly motivated¹. And fire people who are not.</p><p>You can try to motivate your colleagues yourself, but it&#39;s extremely hard. If you give them books to read, they will return them unopened a few weeks later. If you give them an advice, they will not listen, because they don&#39;t care².</p><p>You can:</p><ul><li><p>Convince your boss to set a number of strict rules in your company: <strong>style guidelines</strong>, etc. This will not motivate those people to do a better job, but at least they will not be able to commit source code which doesn&#39;t match the requirements.</p></li><li><p>Work on the requirements, especially <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/118376/functional-or-non-functional-requirement/118446#118446">non-functional requirements</a>. What about a requirement which tells that a specific project must contain less than 5 000 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb385914.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lines of IL code</a> (no, I&#39;m not talking about the <strong>meaningless LOC</strong>)³? What about requiring to obtain specific results at <strong>cyclomatic complexity</strong> or <strong>class coupling</strong>?</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of hours you spend in your company doing <strong>code reviews</strong>. Specify what is reviewed: if you have a checklist, add the points related to refactoring, readability, clean and useful comments, etc. If you don&#39;t have a checklist, you must.</p></li><li><p>Use [more] <strong>pair programming</strong>. It may help improve the code quality and motivate the less motivated coworkers.</p></li><li><p>Use the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/how-much-should-you-pay-developers/">compensation system</a> similar to what is used at Fog Creek.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><sup>¹ That&#39;s what interviews are about: before hiring you, <strong>the human resources must asset not only your technical level, but also your motivation</strong>. Sadly, some companies forget about this second part of the interview, and hire people who don&#39;t enjoy programming too much. Happily, in most cases, the work in <em>those</em> companies is never enjoyable, and Joel test rarely exceeds 2.</sup></p><p><sup>² They <em>really</em> don&#39;t care, even if they gain less money. I&#39;m pretty close to one of my customers (I&#39;m a freelancer) who <em>believes</em> that his work is to develop websites for his own customers. He also have a designer. I told them many times about the ways they can increase their productivity by 2 or more. If they just hired somebody competent, they would increase their revenue by at least 3. But they have enough money, and don&#39;t care about quality or how much they cost to the ignorant customers, compared to somebody productive.</sup></p><p><sup>³ What I mean is the number of lines of IL code which you see in <strong>Code Metrics in Visual Studio</strong>, the metric which actually means something. The <em>real</em> LOC doesn&#39;t matter and you don&#39;t have to measure it; it&#39;s one of the most stupid metrics ever. Enforcing IL lines of code means that developers will be forced to actually refactor code, and not just to collapse ten lines of code in a single unreadable line.</sup></p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
