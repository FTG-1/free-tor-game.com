I would normally create a full view and pass this back to the browser on a full page request, unless there were specific areas that I did not want to populate straight away and would then use DOM page load events to call the server to load other areas using AJAX.</p><p>Also, when it came to partial page refreshing, I would call an MVC action method which would return the HTML fragment which I could then use to populate parts of the page. This would be for areas that I did not want to slow down initial page load, or areas that fitted better with AJAX calls. One example would be for table paging. If you want to move on to the next page, I would prefer it if an AJAX call got that info rather than using a full page refresh. But the AJAX call would still return an HTML fragment.</p><p>My question is. Are my thoughts on this archaic because I come from a .net background rather than a pure front end background?</p><p>An intelligent front end developer that I work with, prefers to do more or less nothing in the MVC views, and would rather do everything on the front end. Right down to web API calls populating the page. So that rather than calling an MVC action method, which returns HTML, he would prefer to return a standard object and use javascript to create all the elements of the page.</p><p>The front end developer way means that any benefits that I normally get with MVC model validation, including client side validation, would be gone. It also means that any benefits that I get with creating the views, with strongly typed html templates etc would be gone.</p><p>I believe this would mean I would need to write the same validation for front end and back end validation. The javascript would also need to have lots of methods for creating all the different parts of the DOM. For example, when adding a new row to a table, I would normally use the MVC partial view for creating the row, and then return this as part of the AJAX call, which then gets injected into the table. By using a pure front end way, the javascript would would take in an object (for, say, a product) for the row from the api call, and then create a row from that object. Creating each individual part of the table row.</p><p>The website in question will have lots of different areas, from administration, forms, product searching etc. A website that I don&#39;t think requires to be architected in a single page application way.</p><p>What are everyone&#39;s thoughts on this?</p><p>I am interested to hear from front end devs and back end devs.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>I&#39;m also somewhat skeptical that every new web app needs to be an SPA but one thing I&#39;m 100% sold on as a generalist with the bulk of his experience on the client side is that a service-oriented architecture that hands off raw data rather than HTML to the client is the way to go whether you&#39;re loading prebuilt pages/views from the server and doing a lot of dynamic stuff with data after page load or building almost everything 100% with JavaScript.</p><p>The reasons this is preferable to a client-side dev are much the same as the reasons nobody wants HTML in the database. What&#39;s the client-side dev supposed to do when they want to resort a table for instance when they&#39;ve been handed HTML? The performance cost of handling all that on the client is trivial compared to making another server request to do that for you. Also, HTML-building is pretty well-covered in JS-land. Sorting data and building new HTML table rows out of it is pretty trivial work for an experienced client-side dev.</p><p>And of what use is the back end architecture to a front end for another device that might need to do something exotic like implement widgets that are 100% canvas or a totally different HTML structure? Why should a client-side dev have to load up visual studio or knock on the back end devs door to make a strictly presentational tweak?</p><p>As for your concerns about the loss of strongly typed template validation, trust me when I say that if you&#39;re dealing with a competent client-side dev, you will find no .NET framework or visual studio tool that is more coal-to-diamond-to-dust-crushingly anal about well-formed, valid HTML than s/he is.</p><p>From the full-stack perspective, I like it because it means I&#39;ll never have to fish for business or app logic some yutz decided to drop into the templating layer. Not to mention the per-user load it takes off of your servers while in many cases actually improving load experience for the user in modern browsers with modern computers.</p><p>I think it&#39;s also easier to reason about the back end architecture when you&#39;ve fully isolated it from all the presentation stuff. You&#39;re no longer grabbing data to mash it into some HTML. You&#39;re pulling it together to create an implementation-independent data structure that concerns itself more with general use than what&#39;s going to be done with it on the other side. IMO, that tends to lead to more consistency in how things are handled since the data is now an end goal rather than the second to last step of a process and there&#39;s fewer opportunities for unrelated concerns to get their wires crossed.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
