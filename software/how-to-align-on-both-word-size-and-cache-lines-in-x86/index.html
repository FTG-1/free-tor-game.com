That doesn&#39;t really make too much sense, so I think I need to do <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/coding-for-performance-data-alignment-and-structures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a bit more</a> to understand exactly <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/data-alignment-when-migrating-to-64-bit-intel-architecture" rel="nofollow noreferrer">how cache aligning works</a>.</p><p>But thanks to this great answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/381244/purpose-of-memoryalignment/381368#381368">Purpose of memory alignment</a> I see how alignment is beneficial, so I would like to learn what it would mean in practice to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment#Typical_alignment_of_C_structs_on_x86" rel="nofollow noreferrer">alignment</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">word</a> and to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3928995/how-do-cache-lines-work">cache line</a>, together.</p><p>For example, take unicode encoded in utf-8. If you were to store that in memory and access it most efficiently in terms of word alignment and cache line alignment, I&#39;m wondering what that would look like / mean.</p><p>Some examples are:</p><ol><li>Accessing individual characters.</li><li>Accessing large blocks of text.</li></ol><p>From what it sounds like, on a 64-bit machine, you would do this (I&#39;m still a bit confused on how to apply it, which is the reason for the question), where the letters would be unicode encoded in ascii (for the simple case of utf-8, just using ascii):</p><pre><code>a b a b a b ...
</code></pre><p>That would look like:</p><pre><code>01100001 01100010 01100001 01100010 01100001 01100010 ...
</code></pre><p>Or more specifically:</p><pre><code>011000010110001001100001011000100110000101100010...
</code></pre><p>To add more characters to the mix (adding newlines for readability, not adding it to the data):</p><pre><code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s 26 x n, where let&#39;s say n is 100, so 2600 8-bit characters (2600 bytes) stacked next to each other. From my understanding, you could say these are &#34;8-bit aligned&#34;, or &#34;1-byte aligned&#34;.</p><p>But now there are two problems:</p><ol><li>Word alignment (and how to figure out what your machine&#39;s word alignment is).</li><li>Cache line alignment (assuming all 64-bit machines use 64 bytes as cache line alignment, which is what I&#39;ve seen from the web).</li></ol><p>Since we have 2600 bytes, we could theoretically have 2600 / 64 = 40.625 â‰ˆ 41 cache line aligned chunks, and if the word size was 2 bytes, then 2600 / 2 = 1300 word-aligned chunks.</p><p>Now I&#39;m lost, I don&#39;t see how we are supposed to access or alternatively organize the data so it takes advantage of these 2 alignment conditions (word and cache line alignment). I already feel like I&#39;m going to create more confusion than is necessary for the question if I try to explain more.</p><p>So my question is, how to (a) organize this utf-8 string in memory so that (b) you can take advantage of the 2 alignment conditions, while (c) accessing the data (either individual characters, or chunks between word size and cache line size, or or chunks larger than cache line size). I don&#39;t really know what &#34;accessing larger than 64 bits at a time&#34; would mean, since registers are limited like that. So again, don&#39;t really understand how the cache alignment works, and interested to know how to align to both conditions properly in this case as a practical example.</p><p>Sidenote: I don&#39;t need to know exactly how to do it for x86, like which instructions to use and whatnot (unless it is easy / straightforward to describe). I am just looking for at a high level how it works, using x86 as a starting point.</p><p>Another way I try looking at this comes after <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/data-alignment-when-migrating-to-64-bit-intel-architecture" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reading</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Align 8-bit data at any address [don&#39;t understand this]</li><li>Align 16-bit data to be contained within an aligned four-byte word</li><li>Align 32-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of four</li><li>Align 64-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of eight</li><li>Align 80-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of sixteen</li><li>Align 128-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of sixteen</li></ul></blockquote><p>Don&#39;t quite follow exactly, but say for 8-bit data we align to a 4-byte word. That means it would look like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;letter&gt; &lt;empty&gt; &lt;empty&gt; &lt;empty&gt; &lt;letter&gt; &lt;empty&gt; &lt;empty&gt; &lt;empty&gt; ...
</code></pre><p>So:</p><pre><code>a---b---a---b---...
</code></pre><p>That seems like a lot of wasted space. That would mean that plain text requires 4x the actual size of the text to store in memory, which doesn&#39;t seem right.</p><p>Finally, when they talk about how if you <em>don&#39;t</em> align to the boundaries, it will fetch the extra data, I keep thinking &#34;won&#39;t it do a fetch for the empty space anyways&#34;. I don&#39;t see how if the memory is full or not at a specific point that fetching some extra data would be harmful. That is to say, say the data was like this:</p><pre><code>abcdef...
</code></pre><p>And 4-byte aligned. That means to access <code>a</code> we would be actually fetching <code>abcd</code>, to fetch <code>b</code> it would also fetch <code>abcd</code>, etc.. But I don&#39;t see how that is any different from fetching <code>a---</code> in this layout:</p><pre><code>a---b---c---d---e---f---...

   char c;
   int  i;
}
</code></pre><p>Struct <code>S</code> declares <code>c</code>, as a 1-byte item, and it will be at offset 0 in the struct.Â  The field <code>i</code>, is, let&#39;s say, a 4-byte item.Â  After <code>c</code> the next available offset is 1 but that is not suitably aligned for a 4-byte value, so the compiler will insert 3 padding bytes and use offset 4 for <code>i</code>, making the size of the struct <code>sizeof(struct S)</code> is 8, even though it only stores 5 bytes of information.</p><p>Let&#39;s also talk about endian-ness.Â  If you have a string of bytes, then each succesive byte is stored at the next higher byte address (just add 1 to the address to get to the next one) â€” However, big-endian machines store the 4 bytes needed to make up a 4-byte word reversed from little-endian machines.Â  So, if you wanted to use word-sized access on your string &#34;abcd&#34;, you would see a difference between a big and little-endian machine: the big-endian machine would give you &#39;abcd&#39; whereas the little-endian machine will give you &#39;dcba&#39;.</p><p>In summary, it is generally best not to use the same memory both as bytes and as words (at the same time): if it holds bytes, then use byte-sized access, and if it holds words, then use word-sized access.Â  Note this will naturally happen unless you do &#34;bad things&#34; like cast pointers to a type other than what they originally pointed to.Â  (There are times when you might need to, and, authors of routines like <code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code> play some tricks for performance.)Â  We can also note that it is not even possible to mix byte-sized and word-sized accesses (for the same data/object/array) in a language like Java (without resorting to serialization) since it doesn&#39;t offer the low-level feature of casting pointers.</p><p>The compiler and runtime (e.g. malloc) cooperate to make sure your data is properly aligned (perhaps even if over-aligned).Â  For example, the stack, before <code>main</code>, should be initially aligned (by the runtime) to at least a 16-byte boundary, and then the compiler can create stack frames that are rounded up to a 16-byte size so the stack and all local variables remain aligned during function calls.Â  Global variables get similar treatment, and we have already discussed heap allocations.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
