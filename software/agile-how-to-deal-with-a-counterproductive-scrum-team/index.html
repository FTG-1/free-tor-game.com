One person does, but the others are silent and I have to deal with this every time.</p><p>Daily Scrum is again just a waste of time for them because none of them bothers to talk and plan the day. They just state &#34;I worked on task X yesterday and will work on that again today.&#34; And most of the time they just joke around until I get more stern.</p><p>I have been very large when it comes to how they spent their time during these events. But I&#39;m dying on the inside because I have a passion for this and they don&#39;t care anymore.</p><p>Today the person who&#39;s always against me told me to stop saying &#34;They said this is what they committed to for this Sprint&#34; because, in his words, &#34;We never complete a Sprint. We just move in tasks and take in new ones in the next Sprint to fill up a quota. We do KanBan in reality. So stop saying that.&#34;</p><p>I understand why he says this, but he doesn&#39;t seem to realize that this is how it is because him and everybody else on the team don&#39;t care. They just do work instead of dealing with impediments. They complain about the impediments, but don&#39;t do anything about them. And when I try to help they just shrug it off.</p><p>They used to give a damn, but over the past two years their willingness has declined to more or less rock bottom.</p><p>How can I make them see that joking around and wasting time during these meetings costs the company a lot of money?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>You may have heard a lot of statistics about failed software projects and came to the conclusion that the failure is not of a technical nature. Technological problems can be solved via hundreds of technical solutions, but solving problems in your workplace atmosphere by using Scrum is not going to work.</p><p>My suggestion here is to completely stop looking at this as a technical issue. It&#39;s not about Scrum, it&#39;s not about daily standups, sprints, retrospectives or anything else like that. You need to get in touch with your team and find an effective way of working that satisfies them as well as you and your superiors.</p><p>If they think dailies are a bad idea, you should not tell them to do dailies and try to punch your reasoning into them. Think for yourself what it is that dailies offer to you. Check with your team whether they value those advantages as well. Find out why they do not share your understanding - as in understanding their point of view, not as in convincing them of anything. Then check whether dailies actually help your team, or if you can achieve more with some other mechanism. The funny thing about Scrum masters is that they are servants to their team - you may well serve them best by abolishing Scrum altogether.</p><p>In summary, stop focusing on Scrum and instead get back to the basics of agility.
