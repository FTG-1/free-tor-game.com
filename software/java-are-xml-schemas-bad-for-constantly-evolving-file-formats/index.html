The format of this data is well-defined, but the project is constantly evolving, so the definition keeps changing! To cope with the change I defined a simple REST interface on the server that offers only key-value storage. Clients can store or retrieve a chunk of data by referencing a unique key. This is nice because I don&#39;t have to modify the server interface (or the backend database) when the data format changes. To the server, it&#39;s just a bunch of opaque blobs.</p><p>Of course, the issue then becomes, &#34;What goes inside the blob?&#34; For that I wrote an XML Schema that defines the content of a blob. At first it was great, since the Schema gives a bunch of nice things &#34;for free&#34;: A formal yet human-readable spec of the file format, automatic validation of its contents, marshalling/unmarshalling to a stream, and auto-generated Java classes for programmatic access to the data.</p><p>But then change happened! The Schema had to be altered, and naturally I ran into forward- and backward-compatibility issues. To deal with the constantly changing Schema, I came up with a solution that embeds a version number into the XML namespace, and I apply a series of XSL Stylesheets to &#34;upgrade&#34; any given blob to the latest version. For example, I&#39;m now on version 1.3 of my Schema, so when I unmarshal a blob, I run it through a 1.0-to-1.1 XSLT, then a 1.1-to-1.2 XSLT, and finally a 1.2-to-1.3 XSLT. This works, but it&#39;s not sustainable because the chain keeps getting longer, which lowers performance and sucks up memory, plus I have to keep writing new Stylesheets, which takes time and isn&#39;t fun.</p><p>Now here&#39;s the funny thing&#8230; In addition to the Java clients, the project also has iOS apps as clients, and iOS has none of the nice enterprise-y features associated with XML Schemas. There&#39;s no validation of the stream, no auto-generation of Objective-C classes, etc., just a low-level event-driven XML parser. But ironically I&#39;m finding this <em>so</em> much easier! For example, if the XML gets a new element, I just add a new <code>if</code> clause. If an element goes away, I remove its clause. Basically, I do a &#34;best effort&#34; at interpreting the XML stream, silently ignoring any unrecognized elements. I don&#39;t need to think about what version the file format is or whether it&#39;s valid. Plus this is much faster because there&#39;s no XSLT chaining, and it saves a lot of my time because I don&#39;t have to write any XSLT code.</p><p>So far this approach has worked out great, and I&#39;ve not missed having an XML Schema on the iOS side. I&#39;m now wondering if a Schema, despite its nice feature set, is totally the wrong technology for a file format that often changes. I&#39;m thinking about ditching my XML Schema altogether and using the same &#34;best effort&#34; low-level approach in Java that I&#39;m doing in iOS.</p><p>So is my negative assessment of XML Schemas correct? Or is there something I&#39;ve missed? Perhaps I need to rethink the server interface? Or maybe I shouldn&#39;t have been using XML in the first place? I&#39;m open to all suggestions. Thanks for reading!</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>I think you are really asking a broader question, &#34;is having a strict definition of a file format a good thing for a rapidly evolving project&#34;.</p><p>To answer your immediate question, though: yes, they are.  The XML schema gives you a strict definition of the format, answer a lot of questions about validity, provides great documentation, and allows you to confidently know that a specific version of the document has a specific form.</p><p>They are not the be-all and end-all, though: they define structure, not semantics, so you can still change the &#34;meaning&#34; of a tag between version of the document without having to change the schema.  That causes just as much trouble.</p><p>To answer the question I think you are asking: yes, the XML schema is a good thing.</p><p>It is forcing you to address a painful fact, which is that your data exchange is constantly changing versions, and that means you have to adapt your system to account for that.</p><p>If you only had the IOS model, where you take a &#34;rough guess&#34; at what this version means, you open the door to all sorts of trouble in the long run.  For example, it becomes trivial for someone to assume that &#34;element foo being present means version 1.2, so tag bar means ...&#34;.</p><p>That is great, right until version 2.0 adds back the foo element, with a different meaning, and tag bar isn&#39;t even there.  Welcome to &#34;inconsistent behaviour&#34; city.</p><p>If you use XML without schemas, or JSON, or something else that doesn&#39;t impose that cost on you then only a tiny bit of the problem goes away.  You still have to deal with all four versions of the input, but you have less tools to help you out.</p><p>You should, in my opinion, generally prefer to make the pain of changes proportional to their real, long term cost.  Changing the data exchange format has a high long term cost - you have to deal with compatibility, with data upgrades, and that sort of thing.</p><p>If that costs little you will be tempted to do it a lot, and then will pay the maintenance cost tomorrow.  If it costs more now, you might think harder - can you do more than one thing in this change?  Can you get away without it?  Can you do it smarter?</p><p>In short, I think your real problem is that your file format changes often, not that you used (or didn&#39;t use) XML schemas.</p><p>(Also, are your users really happy if the server or client randomly drops content that is represented in the newer version?  I would be surprised if that remains true forever - another of those long term costs you need to recognise somewhere...)</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
