For example, upon file save, I would serialize a <code>SensorInfo</code> to the file header, instead of serializing a <code>Sensor</code>, which sort of wouldn&#39;t even make sense.</p><p>But now I am confused, because there is a middleground on objects&#39; lifecycle where I cannot decide if I should use one or another, or how to get one from another, or even whether both variants should actually be collapsed to only one class.</p><p>Also, the all too common example <code>Employee</code> class obviously is just a representation of the real person, but nobody would suggest to name the class <code>EmployeeInfo</code> instead, as far as I know.</p><p>The language I am working with is .NET, and this naming pattern seems to be common throughout the framework, for exemple with these classes:</p><ul><li><code>Directory</code> and <code>DirectoryInfo</code> classes;</li><li><code>File</code> and <code>FileInfo</code> classes;</li><li><code>ConnectionInfo</code>class (with no correspondent <code>Connection</code> class);</li><li><code>DeviceInfo</code> class (with no correspondent <code>Device</code> class);</li></ul><p>So my question is: is there a common rationale about using this naming pattern? Are there cases where it makes sense to have pairs of names (<code>Thing</code> and <code>ThingInfo</code>) and other cases where there should only exist the <code>ThingInfo</code> class, or the <code>Thing</code> class, without its counterpart?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>I think &#34;info&#34; is a misnomer. Objects have state and actions: &#34;info&#34; is just another name for &#34;state&#34; which is already baked into OOP.</p><p>What are you <em>really</em> trying to model here? You need an object that represents the hardware in software so other code can use it.</p><p>That is easy to say but as you found out, there is more to it than that. &#34;Representing hardware&#34; is surprisingly broad. An object that does that has several concerns:</p><ul><li>Low-level device communication, whether it be talking to the USB interface, a serial port, TCP/IP, or proprietary connection.</li><li>Managing state. Is the device turned on? Ready to talk to software? Busy?</li><li>Handling events. The device produced data: now we need to generate events to pass to other classes that are interested.</li></ul><p>Certain devices such as sensors will have fewer concerns than say a printer/scanner/fax multifunction device. A sensor likely just produces a bit stream, while a complex device may have complex protocols and interactions.</p><p>Anyway, back to your specific question, there are several ways to do this depending on your specific requirements as well as the complexity of the hardware interaction.</p><p>Here is an example of how I would design the class hierarchy for a temperature sensor:</p><ul><li><p>ITemperatureSource: interface that represents anything that can produce temperature data: a sensor, could even be a file wrapper or hard-coded data (think: mock testing).</p></li><li><p>Acme4680Sensor: ACME model 4680 sensor (great for detecting when the Roadrunner is nearby). This may implement multiple interfaces: perhaps this sensor detects both temperature and humidity. This object contains program-level state such as &#34;is the sensor connected?&#34; and &#34;what was the last reading?&#34;</p></li><li><p>Acme4680SensorComm: used <em>solely</em> for communicating with the physical device. It does not maintain much state. It is used for sending and receiving messages. It has a C# method for each of the messages the hardware understands.</p></li><li><p>HardwareManager: used for getting devices. This is essentially a factory that caches instances: there should only be one instance of a device object for each hardware device. It has to be smart enough to know that if thread A requests the ACME temperature sensor and thread B requests the ACME humidity sensor, these are actually the same object and should be returned to both threads.</p></li></ul><hr/><p>At the top level you will have interfaces for each hardware type. They describe actions your C# code would take on the devices, using C# data types (not e.g. byte arrays which the raw device driver might use).</p><p>At the same level you have an enumeration class with one instance for each hardware type. Temperature sensor might be one type, humidity sensor another.</p><p>One level below this are the actual classes that implement those interfaces: they represent one device similar the Acme4680Sensor I described above. Any particular class may implement multiple interfaces if the device can perform multiple functions.</p><p>Each device class has its own private Comm (communication) class that handles the low-level task of talking to the hardware.</p><p>Outside of the hardware module, the only layer that is visible is the interfaces/enum plus the HardwareManager. The HardwareManager class is the factory abstraction that handles the instantiation of device classes, caching instances (you <em>really</em> do not want two device classes talking to the same hardware device), etc. A class that needs a particular type of sensor asks the HardwareManager to get the device for the particular enum, which it then figures out if it is already instantiated, if not how to create it and initialize it, etc.</p><p>The goal here is to <em>decouple</em> business logic from low-level hardware logic. When you are writing code that prints sensor data to the screen, that code should not care what type of sensor you have <em>if and only if</em> this decoupling is in place which centers on those hardware interfaces.</p><hr/><p><img src="../../../i.stack.imgur.com/HeNOR.png" alt="UML class diagram example showing the design described in this answer"/></p><p>Note: there are associations between the HardwareManager and each device class that I did not draw because the diagram would have turned into arrow soup.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
