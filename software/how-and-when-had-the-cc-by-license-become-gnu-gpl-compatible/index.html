That is a formal process, somewhat similar to publishing a new license version; if it would succeed, there should be an announcement from CC, as it was when CC BY-SA 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/44030" rel="nofollow">was declared</a> mutually compatible with the <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/" rel="nofollow">Free Art License</a> v1.3.</p><p>As far as I know, there was no such process for CC BY. However, firstly, a week ago, along with updating links from v2.0 of CC BY to v4.0, a statement about incompatibility of CC BY with GNU GPL and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" rel="nofollow">GNU FDL</a> <a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/licenses/license-list.html?root=www&amp;r1=1.421&amp;r2=1.422" rel="nofollow">was removed</a> by FSF Licensing &amp; Compliance Manager Joshua Gay from a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ccby" rel="nofollow">‘Various Licenses’ list</a> on www.gnu.org, which is used as authoritative source on GPL-compatibility; and secondly, two days ago an explicit note that <em>“CC BY 4.0 is compatible with GPLv3”</em> <a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/licenses/license-list.html?root=www&amp;r1=1.427&amp;r2=1.428" rel="nofollow">was added</a> without any noticeable announcement or explanation, as if it is something obvious.</p><p>Is it indeed so obvious? Fourth generation of CC license zoo is about one year old, why only now? And how shall I consider attribution obligations when incorporating a work under CC BY into a work under GPLv3? I guess, as additional requirements under section 7b of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow">GNU GPLv3</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br /> &lt;&#8230;&gt;<br /> b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>These were rhetorical questions though. <strong>Now the actual question.</strong></p><p>I do not understand very well how transitive CC licenses (since second generation) are: are <em>previous</em> versions of CC BY: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/legalcode" rel="nofollow">2.0</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/legalcode" rel="nofollow">2.5</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode" rel="nofollow">3.0</a>; <em>indirectly</em> compatible with GNU GPLv3 now?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Joshua Gay&#39;s edit looks sloppy at best: I found at least 2 clauses and a section in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode</a> that look incompatible with any GPL.
I&#39;ve written a letter to the FSF asking them to clarify this matter and the properties of the edit.</p><p>This is what I just got in reply, from none other than Joshua himself (nested blocks are his quotes from my letter):</p><blockquote><p>Hello,<br/> Thank you for writing.</p><blockquote><ul><li>It doesn&#39;t mark the license as &#34;compatible with the GNU GPL or FDL&#34;
 with the left-side line.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The color doesn&#39;t specify a version number of the GPL. I have been
 waiting for confirmation from our general counsel that CC BY is
 incompatible with GPLv2 and the FDL before updating the color on the
 left hand side. Hopefully that will be soon.</p><blockquote><ul><li>It doesn&#39;t comment on this decision as if it&#39;s something obvious.
 Which it is not:<ul><li>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a3</a> restriction looks drastically incompatible</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>First note that both licenses make use of words like reasonable and
 within reason. Interpretation should be done with that in mind. Here is
 our position on this as I understand it. You are right that we should
 have a more formal statement and I will try to get one prepared that
 we publish on the site.</p><p>GPLv3 7(b) states that you can add terms &#34;Requiring preservation of
 specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that
 material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
 containing it;&#34;</p><p>The FSF interprets this as to include a licensor doing something such
 as removing certain parts of the reasonable legal notices or marking
 them in ways as different from the original.</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s4</a> grants a
 set of rights whose relation to those granted by the GPLv3 is very unclear</li></ul></blockquote><p>How are they unclear? I do not see what is unclear.</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a5B" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a5B</a> appears to forbid relicensing which is a requirement for GPLv3 compatibility as per <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>A person does not need to relicense a work to create a combined work
 with the GPL. A CC BY licensed work that is incorporated into a GPL
 licensed work would retain a copy of the CC BY license and all CC BY
 notices. One would simply add to the work as a whole and in relevant
 plces notices about the GPL and a copy of the GPL.</p><p>CC BY does not restrict adding additional terms so long as those
 additional terms do not restrict &#34;exercise of the Licensed Rights by
 any recipient of the Licensed Material.&#34;</p><p>I will see about adding these clarifications somewhere.<br/> Thanks again for emailing us.</p><p>Joshua Gay<br/> Licensing &amp; Compliance Manager<br/> Free Software Foundation</p></blockquote><p>This is the reply I got on further clarification of CC#s3a3. He believes it&#39;s compatible by doing a narrow interpretation:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>The incompatibility as it appears to me is that GPL gives no right to
 change any terms
 for a licensee who has already received a license (or receives it from
 an older copy) -
 since a license is irrevocable and is granted on the terms that
 accompany a specific copy.</p><p>So, your interpretation of this CC clause is that it only applies
 to the moment one receives a copy from the copyright holder, not to
 any later moment
 or receiving it from any other party?</p></blockquote><p>That is my current understanding. Do I have a reason to think it would
 mean at a later date? I assumed such a request would need to be made
 alongside the license itself. I will ask Creative Commons what their
 interpretation is.</p><p>I am not a lawyer and I have no ideas how courts would interpret this.
 But, I&#39;m not sure how one could reasonable expect a work to be put
 into the wild, modified and remixed for a period of 75 or 80 years and
 then it be reasonable that a licensor could come along and ask for all
 of those notices to be removed.</p></blockquote><p>And here&#39;s the final update, right from the horse&#39;s mouth. <strong>The &#34;reference removal&#34;
CC clause is an obstacle. But <em>as of now</em>, Joshua doesn&#39;t consider it a strong enough one
to condemn CC-BY as incompatible.</strong> (<a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/licenses/license-list.html?root=www&amp;r1=1.428&amp;r2=1.431" rel="nofollow noreferrer">diff to the current licenses.html as of this writing</a>)</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>I suspect the clause does have such a use in mind. Its intended use
 appears to be the case where a copyright holder sees their work used
 in
 a context that they deem inappropriate - so they wish any reference to
 them
 removed so that their perceived reputation doesn&#39;t suffer.</p></blockquote><p>Creative Commons sent me a clarification and it is the case that the
 intent of the license is so that a user could ask after the fact. <em>However</em>, they explained that &#34;to the extent reasonably practicable&#34; gives a person a lot of flexibility in being able to simply deny the
 request of the original licensor. I am interested in finding out some
 other legal opinions on how strong the language &#34;to the extent
 reasonably practicable&#34;. Like how easy it is to make that argument as
 a licensee. I believe this is will be the next question in the public
 discussion mailing list. I will also open up an internal discussion at
 the FSF and with our lawyers to make sure they think the language
 &#34;reasonably practicable&#34; is sufficiently strong.</p></blockquote><p>Why did he make the edit when he did? Perhaps because that&#39;s when he checked the compatibility. He <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2015-February/thread.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">actively participates in the CC-BY-SA - GPLv3 compatibility effort</a> - that could very well be the reason that drew his attention to that matter.</p><p>The &#34;transitive&#34; compatibility of the earlier versions of the CC-BY has already been <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/272335/how-and-when-had-the-cc-by-license-become-gnu-gpl-compatible#comment556709_272335">well explained by apsillers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Earlier licenses are incompatible <em>on their own</em> but are compatible if the work&#39;s license <em>allows relicensing to a compatible version.</em> As you can see, this is a general principle not specific to a license.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
