What should my friend be looking at to modernize his codebase?</p><p>UPDATE: Thanks @Mark and everyone who has answered. The reasons my friend is asking this question is that it&#39;s a perfect time in the projects lifecycle to do a review.  Bringing research assistants up to speed in Fortran takes time (I like C#, and especially the tooling and can&#39;t imagine going back to older languages!!)</p><p>I liked the suggestion of keeping the pure number crunching in Fortran, but wrapping it in something newer. Perhaps Python as that seems to be getting a stronghold in academia as a general-purpose programming language that is fairly easy to pick up.</p><p>See <em><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/87047/can-i-legally-publish-my-fortran-90-wrappers-to-nvidias-cufft-library-from-cudal">Medical Imaging</a></em> and a guy who has written a Fortran wrapper for CUDA, <em><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/87047/can-i-legally-publish-my-fortran-90-wrappers-to-nvidias-cufft-library-from-cudal">Can I legally publish my Fortran 90 wrappers to Nvidias&#39; CUFFT library (from the CUDA SDK)?</a></em>.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>The demands you have put actually put Fortran at the top of the list, for problems like this:</p><p>a) number crunching<br/> b) parallelable<br/> c) it was and still is the <em>de facto</em> language taught outside of CS studies (to engineers who aren&#39;t professional programmers).<br/> d) has an incredible(!) industry backing, number-of-industry-grade-compilers-wise, with none of the vendors showing the least signs of abandoning that branch. One of Intel&#39;s representatives not far ago revealed that sales of their Fortran products are higher than any other in their development tools.</p><p><strong>It is also a language which is incredibly easy to pick up.</strong> I don&#39;t agree that it takes time for bringing research assistants up to speed. My first textbook on it had no more than, oh I don&#39;t know, 30 (?) pages of sparse printed text. <strong>It is a language in which after learning 10 keywords, one can write medium-sized programs. I would dare say that those 30 pages written in default Word text would make a more than comprehensive &#34;Fortran manual&#34; for most users.</strong></p><p><strong>If you&#39;re interested in CUDA, you might want to check <a href="http://www.pgroup.com/products/pvf.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Portland Group&#39;s compiler</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.pgroup.com/resources/cudafortran.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">which supports it</a>. I&#39;m not familiar with the finer details, but people generally talk of it with praise.</p><p><strong>Apart from that, for paralleling programs you have available OpenMP, MPI and now the upcoming (and long awaited) co-arrays, which <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Intel&#39;s compiler has recently</a> implemented.</strong> To not waste words, Fortran has a very fine gamma of &#34;libraries&#34; for parallelizing programs.</p><p><a href="http://www.roguewave.com/products/imsl-numerical-libraries/fortran-library.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Industry standard numerical libraries</a> are developed for it foremost, other languages following more or less in the function/routines portfolio.</p><p><strong>All that being said, I would however</strong> (depends on when it was originally written) <strong>recommend if it is, let&#39;s say, F77 code or older, rewriting it partially through time to newer dialects - F90 at least, if possible with F2003 features. A <a href="http://www.fortranrefactoring.com.ar/papers/Fortran-Refactoring-for-Legacy-Systems.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">paper / thesis on that topic was recently published</a> (medium-sized PDF file ahead). Not only can that, if done properly, ensure portability across multiple platforms, but will also make it more easy for future maintenance.</strong></p><p>p.s. As far as &#34;future maintenance&#34; goes, just an anecdote which I sometimes like to mention. While writing my thesis, I reused some code from my mentor, written 35 years ago from the time of writing. It compiled with only one error; a statement missing at the end, due to copy-paste mistake :)</p><hr/><p><em><strong>@DaveMateer (reply to comment)</strong></em> - I&#39;m going to make a comment in the following which may be a bit impolite, but please don&#39;t take it the wrong way, for it is in the fair intentions.</p><p>It seems to me you&#39;re tackling this &#34;problem&#34; in the wrong way. What I mean in a
few short points (for it is very late in here, and my ability to make up
readable (let alone comprehensible) sentences leaves me after 10p.m.)</p><p><em><strong>a)</strong></em> You mentioned you&#39;re trying to minimize extra coding time, yet you&#39;re
considering a rewrite from a language specialized for numerical computing to one from <em>a
colorful choice of languages</em>, if you&#39;ll pardon my expression</p><ul><li>some of which don&#39;t have support for multidimensional arrays, amongst other
things</li><li>most of them are unsuitable for heavy numerical work (of parallel processing
capabilities of Haskell and Hadoop I admit, I know nothing about ... but have
never heard them even mentioned in those circles)</li><li>it possibly has been tried, but I&#39;ve never heard of a rewrite from Fortran,
a language for discretized problems, to a functional language</li><li>there has been a discussion recently on comp.lang.fortran (try searching
through Google Groups) on the aspects of scientific computing &#34;in the cloud&#34;<br/> (wouldn&#39;t like to demotivate you, but to be fair, no one was really sure what
that term even represents, let alone had an example of a successful application.
Most people agreed that potential exists, but so far they&#39;re happy the way things
work for now.). A lot of problems are not suitable for that kind of parallelisation either.</li></ul><p><em><strong>b)</strong></em> What would be the costs of such a rewrite? People/hours.</p><p><em><strong>c)</strong></em> Correct versions of the libraries to compile...- is a problem in any
language that cannot be avoided, however you look at it.</p><p><em><strong>d)</strong></em> I&#39;ve heard of Python (a nice language really) used in parallel applications
on a few occasions, but its penetration of that market still doesn&#39;t seem to be
rising, and its ever changing nature makes it a very poor choice for a long term
project (think backward compatibility). Some people like it very much as a &#34;glue&#34; language.</p><p>Ugh, if I think of anything else, will add it tomorrow. Gotta get some sleep...</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
