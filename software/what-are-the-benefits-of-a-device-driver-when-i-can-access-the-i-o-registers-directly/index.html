Now that&#39;s my opinion, and I&#39;m sure many Linux/C gurus out there would disagree, but there&#39;s one thing that I just can&#39;t wrap my head around here.</p><p>Every CPU/MCU exposes a C library that defines I/O registers, ports, etc. for accessing (both reads and writes) every single pin on the chip. On AVR controllers, for instance, there is <code>&lt;avr/io.h</code>&gt;. For ARM chips there is <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php" rel="nofollow">CMSIS</a>.</p><p>So my question is this:</p><p><strong>Why would I go to all the &#39;trouble&#39; (more work) of following the guidelines in that article and building a proper device driver in Linux, when I could just write a C library that uses one of these processor-provided I/O registry accessors (again, <code>avr/io.h</code>, CMSIS, etc.) to access all the pins on the chip (which seems like less work)?</strong></p><p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason: I&#39;m just not seeing it. What is gained by using a proper device driver? What is lost by not using one and just using one of these libs directly?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Asking why microcontrollers like the AVR family let you twiddle the pins directly when an operating system like Linux requires device drivers is an apples-to-suspension-bridges comparison.</p><p>Microcontrollers are typically single-threaded free-for-alls with no supervisor (OS) and all code has full access to memory, I/O and anything else the chip offers.  This means that if one part of the application sets GPIO pin 3 high and needs to see that it stays that way, there&#39;s nothing that prevents some other part of the code from setting it low again.  The developer is responsible for putting those kinds of interlocks into place.  There&#39;s also no notion of devices: the MCU has a set of registers that control I/O that&#39;s the same on every copy of the chip and that&#39;s all there is.  If you want to run your program on a different chip in the same family with different I/O, you&#39;re likely going to have to rewrite parts of it or, at the very least, recompile it with chip-specific headers or libraries.</p><p>General-purpose processors like the one in your desktop PC don&#39;t have the I/O features built in, opting instead to communicate with external peripherals whose registers are mapped somewhere in memory.  The model is the same, though.  If you plop an x86 CPU into a board where you know the I/O mappings, it&#39;s entirely possible to write AVR-style programs that do their own I/O, but you&#39;re going to be doing it on bare metal without any of the facilities an operating system provides.</p><p>A lot of software was done this way, but at some point in history, it became apparent that the model wasn&#39;t going to scale.  People wanted to write programs to run on a given processor without having to fuss with building a separate version for each combination of peripherals.  This spawned operating systems, which let a program say things like &#34;send the character <code>C</code> across serial port 2&#34; using a standard software interface.  The code behind that standard interface was built up for the specific set of hardware on that system and knew that serial port 2 was a Brand X UART mapped at address 1234.  In microcomputing, this kind of thing became most evident with the appearance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system in the 1970s.  Vendors selling computers would provide a version of the OS with custom drivers for their specific hardware.  Do-it-your-selfers had to patch up generic versions by hand to work with what they had.  The result was that they all ended up with systems that could run off-the-shelf versions of software without having to modify it.</p><p>Modern operating systems do pretty much the same thing but with a much higher level of sophistication.  Systems (PC-style and even many embedded ones) are built around I/O architectures that are enumerable and dynamic, meaning that the software can figure out what&#39;s present, assign it a memory mapping and use the right functions to communicate with it.  Along with that comes driver infrastructure that lets hardware developers leverage all of that sophistication without having to re-invent it each time and without risk that driver A was going to conflict with something driver B is doing.</p><p>If you decide to try going the poke-the-device-directly route on a full-blown operating system like Linux, the first question you&#39;ll ask is how a userland process gains access to the memory area where the device&#39;s registers are mapped.  The answer (&#34;you can&#39;t&#34;) is what brings up the other reason: multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems don&#39;t trust user programs to be well-behaved.  They&#39;re designed to protect the system from harm and the programs running on the system from each other.  Making this happen brings with it a complex model of interlocks and permissions, all of which contribute to whether or not a program can ask a device driver to do something on its behalf.  The device driver code put into the kernel is given a much greater amount of trust because, presumably, those who wrote it did so carefully.</p><p>The functions you put into a device driver for most flavors of Unix are just the essentials (load, unload, open, close, read, write, ioctl) and are called at the end of a very long chain of decision making.  If a process wants to write to a serial port, the driver code isn&#39;t called until the OS is sure there&#39;s a driver present and functioning for that device, the process has permission to use the device and that the port has been opened by that process.</p><p>This, at long last, is why you write a device driver:  The amount of code you have to develop for a device driver is minuscule compared to the amount of sophistication the rest of the OS provides to go with it.</p><p>Really, it isn&#39;t painful.  It&#39;s just unfamiliar.  Once you&#39;ve done a couple, you&#39;ll wonder why you were making such a fuss about it.  (And trust me, it&#39;s a lot less work now than it was 25 years ago.)</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
