To be more precise, it&#39;s called Macau. I&#39;ve read this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100819/how-do-you-design-object-oriented-projects">answer</a> on StackOverflow and tried to follow the steps from the first answer. I made a narrative in which I describe the general rules of the game and its particularities.</p><blockquote><p>Macao game.  The minimum number of players is 2. The deck of cards<br /> initially contains 52 cards. Each card has the following attributes:</p><ul><li>Suit (diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades)</li><li>Rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, J, Q, K, Joker)</li></ul><p>Starting the game, the deck is shuffled and every player receives 5<br /> cards from it. The first player that remains out of cards is the<br /> winner. Afterwards, a card is taken from the deck and put on the table<br /> with the face up.</p><p>The current player looks at the card that&#39;s been put on the table and<br /> decides whether he can put a card from his packet on the table or not.<br /> A player can put a card on the table if their card is compatible with<br /> the other one.</p><p>Two cards are compatible if they accomplish one of the following<br /> conditions: they have the same rank or the same suit. Expanding upon<br /> the cards domain, there exist several special cards. These have to<br /> obey the specified rules too, but they have an extra attribute: the<br /> special ability. They may have any suit, but these ranks qualify a<br /> card to be special: 2, 3, 4, 7, A, and Joker. The Joker is a wildcard<br /> as it doesn’t need to obey to the earlier specified rule. That is, the<br /> player can put it on the table at any time.</p><p>The next section gives a thorough description of the mentioned cards’<br /> special abilities:</p><ul><li><p>Rank: 7. When put on the table, this card requires the current player to specify a suit. The next player is obliged to put any card<br /> that has the earlier specified suit, otherwise he will receive a new<br /> card from the deck.</p></li><li><p>Rank: 2 and 3. This card obliges the next player to receive 2/3 (2 cards if the rank is 2, same rule for 3) cards from the deck. Now, if<br /> the next player also has a 2 or a 3 with the same suit, or a Joker, then he can<br /> put it on the table and the next player has to receive the total<br /> amount of cards. The same rules apply in a circular manner. If the<br /> next player has a 4 with the same suit, then he can stop the<br /> obligation injected by the previous player.</p></li><li><p>Rank: 4. Special ability: it can stop an obligation injected by the previous player. If it is put over a regular card (i.e. a card<br /> that has no special ability), then it acts like one.</p></li><li>Rank: A (Ace). Special ability: it skips the next player&#39;s turn.</li><li>Rank: Joker. It is a wildcard so it can be put on the table at almost all instances. The exception arises when the card that is on<br /> the top of the table is an A (Ace), then the current player&#39;s turn is<br /> skipped. Special ability: the same as the 2/3 card, except that the<br /> next player will have to receive 5 cards (for the Black Joker) or 10<br /> (in case of the Red one).</li></ul><p>Having the rules clarified, the game continues. If the current player<br /> owns such a compatible card (or more), then it&#39;s his choice whether to<br /> put one on the table or receive a new card from the deck. Also, while<br /> in game, there can appear the situation when the deck would be<br /> emptied. In that case, all the cards from the table that are located<br /> under the top one are taken, shuffled, and used to refill the deck.<br /> The card on the top is untouched.</p><p>Now it&#39;s the next player&#39;s turn, and the earlier described steps<br /> repeat until one of the players remains out of cards. That player is<br /> the winner.</p></blockquote><p>From this narrative I <em>extracted</em> the following classes:</p><ul><li>Card</li><li>Deck</li><li>Player (maybe Hand?)</li><li>Table (that contains the Deck and the stack of already played cards)</li><li>Game</li></ul><p>Here come my problems.</p><ol><li>I&#39;m not sure if I made the right abstractions.</li><li>I wouldn&#39;t know how to design the special cards. Should there exist a separate (inherited from Card) class for every special card? Or should I use composition? Also, how should I implement the Joker cards? They don&#39;t really have a Suit, they just have the Rank.</li><li>Should the Game class manage players&#39; turns and the exceptional cases (those cases when the top card would be a special one)?</li><li>Should <em>Player</em> be just an interface? This would leave space for additional features like an AI player (that implements Player).</li></ol><p>This is my first medium-sized object-oriented project and I want to be sure that I&#39;m on the right path.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><blockquote><p>I&#39;m not sure if I made the right abstractions.</p></blockquote><p>Well, it is a start, but you will find only out if you stop overthinking it and start to write some code <strong>using</strong> these abstractions. This code could be tests, real game logic, or both.</p><blockquote><p>I wouldn&#39;t know how to design the special cards. Should there exist a separate (inherited from Card) class for every special card? Or should I use composition?</p></blockquote><p>Neither. If I got this right, being &#34;special&#34; is just a property which can be derived from the rank. So when a Card class has an attribute <code>Rank</code> (as well as <code>Suit</code>), it carries all the information the game logic requires to make a decision about the &#34;special abilities&#34;.</p><blockquote><p>Also, how should I implement the Joker cards? They don&#39;t really have a Suit, they just have the Rank.</p></blockquote><p>Simple: introduce a fifth Suit &#34;None&#34; for Jokers. Your card&#39;s constructor can throw an exception if someone tries to initialize a card with a suit &#34;None&#34; for non-Jokers or a card with a rank &#34;Joker&#34; and a different suit.</p><blockquote><p>Should the Game class manage players&#39; turns and the exceptional cases (those cases when the top card would be a special one)?</p></blockquote><p>Somewhere you need to implement the game&#39;s logic. Putting it initially into the Game class is a sensible start. If that class evolves, and it becomes too large / gets too many responsibilities, try to identify such responsibilities, give them a name and refactor them to separate classes. There is no need to overanalyse this beforehand.</p><blockquote><p>Should Player be just an interface? This would leave space for additional features like an AI player (that implements Player).</p></blockquote><p>Again, there is no need to make this decision <em>now</em>. Start with one Player class, and when you come to the point where you need a <code>HumanPlayer</code> and an <code>AIPlayer</code>, it is early enough to refactor.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
