However the real chain of events was probably much more subtle &amp; complex than this, and not nearly so sequential. The features which made it into those mainstream languages may have originated elsewhere, perhaps long before.</p><p>Note: I am not asking about the actual merits of pointers vs. references vs. something else. My focus is on the rationales for this apparent shift.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>The rationale was the development of alternatives to pointers.</p><p>Under the hood, any pointer/reference/etc is being implemented as an integer containing a memory address (aka pointer).  When <em>C</em> came out, this functionality was exposed as pointers.  This meant that anything the underlying hardware could do to address memory could be done with pointers.</p><p>This was always &#34;dangerous,&#34; but danger is relative.  When you&#39;re making a 1000 line program, or when you have IBM-grade software quality procedures in place, this danger could be easily addressed.  However, not all software was being developed that way.  As such, a desire for simpler structures came forth.</p><p>If you think about it, an <code>int&amp;</code> and a <code>int* const</code> really have the same level of safety, but one has much nicer syntax than the other. <code>int&amp;</code> could also be more efficient because it could refer to an int stored in a register (anachronism: this was true in the past, but modern compilers are so good at optimizing that you can have a pointer to an integer in a register, as long as you never use any of the features that would require an actual address, like <code>++</code>)</p><p>As we move to <em>Java</em>, we move into languages which provide some security guarantees. <em>C</em> and <em>C++</em> provided none.  Java guarantees that only legal operations get executed.  To do this, java did away with pointers entirely.  What they found is that the vast majority of pointer/reference operations done in real code were things that references were more than sufficient for.  Only in a handful of cases (such as fast iteration through an array) were pointers truly needed.  In those cases, java takes a runtime hit to avoid using them.</p><p>The move has not been monotonic. <em>C#</em> reintroduced pointers, though in a <em>very</em> limited form.  They are marked as &#34;<em>unsafe</em>,&#34; meaning they cannot be used by untrusted code.  They also have explicit rules about what they can and cannot point to (for example, it&#39;s simply <em>invalid</em> to increment a pointer past the end of an array).  However, they found there were a handful of cases where the high performance of pointers were needed, so they put them back in.</p><p>Also of interest would be the functional languages, which have no such concept at all, but that&#39;s a <em>very</em> different discussion.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
