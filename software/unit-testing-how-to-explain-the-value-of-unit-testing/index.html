As you might imagine, the code is very tightly coupled to the exact implementation &#8211; even resulting in code that should be in a class and reused across the system being copied and pasted across methods.</p><p>Due to changed requirements, I have been asked to modify a module I previously wrote and that is fairly loosely coupled (not as much as I would like, but as best I can get without having to introduce a lot of other concepts).  I&#39;ve decided to include a suite of unit tests with my revised code to &#34;prove&#34; that it works as expected and demonstrate how testing works; I&#39;m not following true TDD as some of the code is already written but I&#39;m hoping to follow some TDD concepts for the new code I&#39;ll have to create.</p><p>Now, inevitably I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be asked why it&#39;s taking me more than a day or two to write the code, since parts of what I&#39;ll be interacting with already exist in the system (albeit without any tests and very tightly coupled), and when I check the code in I&#39;ll be asked just what this &#34;Tests&#34; project is.  I can explain the basics of testing, but I can&#39;t explain the actual benefits in a way the others would understand (because they think testing requires you to run the app yourself, since often the actual UI matters in determining if the feature &#34;works&#34; or not).  They don&#39;t understand the idea of loose coupling (clearly evident by the fact nothing is loosely coupled; there aren&#39;t even any interfaces outside of the code I&#39;ve written), so trying to use that as a benefit would probably earn me a &#34;Huh?&#34; kind of look, and again I can&#39;t be as loose as I would like to without having to rework several existing modules and probably introduce some kind of IoC container, which would be viewed as wasting time and not &#34;programming&#34;.</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can point to this code and say &#34;We should start creating unit tests&#34; without coming off as either condescending (e.g. &#34;Writing tests forces you to write good code.&#34; which would probably be taken to mean code except mine is <em>bad</em>) or without making it seem like a waste of time that doesn&#39;t add any real value?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><blockquote><p>I want to introduce the concept of unit tests (and testing in general) to my co-workers</p></blockquote><p>I think it might be better to start from the practical, not the conceptual, side. Of course, if you find during casual discussion that your coworkers and/or management are interested to hear about unit testing, all the better - then you may google up some concrete experiences / evidence from the web, put together a brief training, etc. However, from what you describe, it sounds like your teammates aren&#39;t very open to this strange new idea.</p><p>In such a situation, I would just start writing my little unit tests without trying to explain too much to anyone first. Add a couple of them whenever I change code, without trying to thoroughly cover all the code (which would take an inordinate amount of time). Ideally, if I manage to strike a fine balance, by the time they notice I am writing unit tests, I may already have a substantial test suite, and some concrete results to show (like &#34;with this test case I managed to catch a bug introduced by last week&#39;s change, which would have otherwise slipped through to QA/production&#34;). That will prove the tests&#39; worth to any serious developer.</p><p>After that, I am in a good position to start explaining the long term benefits of unit testing, like</p><ul><li>it proves that the code works - anytime, anywhere, instantly and automatically, which in turn</li><li>gives confidence to refactor, resulting in improved design and better maintainability,</li><li>and if something gets broken, unit tests give you (almost) instant feedback, as opposed to several days&#39; or weeks&#39; latency if the bug is caught by a separate QA department. Which usually enables you to fix the bug in seconds, instead of debugging for hours/days, in code which has long since dropped from your short term memory.</li></ul><p>See also this related thread: <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/39368/automated-unit-testing-integration-testing-or-acceptance-testing">Automated unit testing, integration testing or acceptance testing</a>.</p><p>And an earlier one from SO: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1383/what-is-unit-testing">What is unit testing?</a></p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
