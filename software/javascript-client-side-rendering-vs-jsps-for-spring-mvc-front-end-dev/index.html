It&#39;s in the early stages of development.</p><p>Here&#39;s the question:</p><p>I&#39;m about to begin a rigorous dive into front-end dev and want to make sure I&#39;m setting myself down the right track. The back-end is built with Spring MVC design, and the limited front-end work I&#39;ve done so far uses Twitter Bootstrap in JSP&#39;s and some simple JavaScript. I haven&#39;t had any issues per se with that stack, but I have the following concerns:</p><h3>Ease and/or Standardization of Development</h3><p>The JSTL syntax required to make highly-interactive pages via JSP&#39;s is getting awfully unwieldy. I&#39;m worried that, when we expand our project and bring on more engineers, there will be a steep-ish initial learning curve, followed by a persistent slow-down in the dev process due to verbosity of JSTL.</p><p>Using JSP&#39;s also seems like a less contemporary approach to front-end dev, in light of how many JS frameworks are popular. I&#39;m imagining it&#39;d be tougher to field a team of front-end or full-stack engineers if we build with JSP&#39;s.</p><p>Should I not worry so much about these issues? Are there pros of server-side rendering with JSP&#39;s that outweigh dev concerns? Can you offer a sense of how wide-spread familiarity with JSP dev is?</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>Server-side rendering has been great for my testing, so far &#8212; but what happens when our app is a massive, historic, global success and downright phenomenon? Will the server get bogged down with all the rendering, if done in JSP&#39;s? Or are traffic concerns better addressed by load-balancing requests to the server and leaving the server-side rendering in place?</p><h3>Maintenance Costs for Server-Side Rendering from a Cloud-hosted Server</h3><p>Along the lines of the performance concerns above, if the app gets a lot of traffic and is rendering views server-side, won&#39;t our bandwidth usage go way up? We&#39;ll be deploying on AWS, which is semi-unfamiliar territory for me, but I&#39;m presuming we&#39;ll pay according to how much bandwidth we consume. Pushing view rendering duties onto client browsers seems like a cost-effective strategy for a cloud-hosted app such as ours. Am I mistaken in that thinking?</p><h3>Cross Browser Compatibility</h3><p>Our app will be marketed to clients who are unfamiliar with technology. I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that such clients will be disproportionately likely to have out-of-date browsers. Old browsers may have compatibility issues with JavaScript rendering &#8212; and ever worse issues with the most modern JS frameworks.</p><p>Are there enough compatibility solutions in modern JS frameworks to resolve this concern? Or is server-side rendering the best-bet, in light of the likelihood of running on outdated browsers?</p><hr/><p>After doing some research on these issues, I&#39;ve got four strategies in mind, for going forward:</p><ol><li><p>Avoid client-side rendering. Learn to love the JSTL chunkiness, stay with all JSP&#39;s.</p></li><li><p>Mark up all static HTML elements in the JSP&#39;s, then populate dynamically generated values/properties/elements according to user interaction (lots of JS, AJAX).</p></li><li><p>Make a minimal HTML markup in the JSP&#39;s, then populate everything in the view with appends to the DOM when the page loads.</p></li><li><p>Completely migrate away from JSP&#39;s, use something like AngularJs.</p></li></ol><p>Basically, all options represent varying degrees of moving away from server-side rendering and towards client-side rendering. Which of these sounds like the best course of action? Is there an option I&#39;ve overlooked?</p><p>It&#39;s still early enough in the front-end dev process to integrate completely novel techs, and I&#39;m new enough to web dev that any of the strategies will involve considerable self-teaching, so nothing should be considered off the table. I&#39;m leaning towards solution strategy #2, so far, as this model would be the least drastic change from the current approach. But, in the interest of building in a way that&#39;ll make future builds easier, and be the most accessible for collaboration, #4 is also looking good.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><blockquote><p>The JSTL syntax required to make highly-interactive pages via JSP&#39;s is getting awfully unwieldy.

Every large company has had to do this; they built their product on a platform that got them to market quickly, and re-built it (in some cases, from the ground-up) when the number of users became enormous.</p><p>That said, I think you can make some sensible choices early on. <em>Unless your system requirements demand large, overblown architectures (they don&#39;t), avoiding them and choosing more nimble and flexible technologies will generally give you better overall performance and better adaptability.</em></p><blockquote><p>Pushing view rendering duties onto client browsers seems like a cost-effective strategy for a cloud-hosted app such as ours.

If your clients want to use computers in the 21st century, <em>they need a modern browser,</em> and it&#39;s easier than it&#39;s ever been to get one and allow it to maintain and update itself automatically and indefinitely.</p><blockquote><p>After doing some research on these issues, I&#39;ve got four strategies in mind...</p></blockquote><p>The way of the future is so-called microservices and client-side UI such as Angular.  And no, I don&#39;t think this just a fad.  Users demand high interactivity with their software applications, and this arrangement can give it to them.  Your back-end JSON web services can be built with anything you like; Node.JS, ASP.NET Web API, whatever.  Maintaining this sort of modularity will make it possible to change out one component without affecting the others.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
