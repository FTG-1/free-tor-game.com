that manages the policy of your pipeline</li><li>a concurrent approach or multi-threading approach</li></ul><p>I will just say that I&#39;m thinking about the hardware here and the worst case scenario, and I have tested this 2 paradigms myself, the async paradigm is a winner at the point that I don&#39;t get why people 90% of the time talk about multi-threading when they want to speed up things or make a good use of their resources.</p><p>I have tested multi-threaded programs and async program on an old machine with an Intel quad-core that doesn&#39;t offer a memory controller inside the CPU, the memory is managed entirely by the motherboard, well in this case performances are horrible with a multi-threaded application, even a relatively low number of threads like 3-4-5 can be a problem, the application is unresponsive and is just slow and unpleasant.</p><p>A good async approach is, on the other hand, probably not faster but it&#39;s not worst either, my application just waits for the result and doesn&#39;t hangs, it&#39;s responsive and there is a much better scaling going on.</p><p>I have also discovered that a context change in the threading world it&#39;s not that cheap in real world scenario, it&#39;s in fact quite expensive especially when you have more than 2 threads that need to cycle and swap among each other to be computed.</p><p>On modern CPUs the situation it&#39;s not really that different, the memory controller it&#39;s integrated but my point is that an x86 CPUs is basically a serial machine and the memory controller works the same way as with the old machine with an external memory controller on the motherboard. The context switch is still a relevant cost in my application and the fact that the memory controller it&#39;s integrated or that the newer CPU have more than 2 core it&#39;s not bargain for me.</p><p>For what i have experienced the concurrent approach is good in theory but not that good in practice, with the memory model imposed by the hardware, it&#39;s hard to make a good use of this paradigm, also it introduces a lot of issues ranging from the use of my data structures to the join of multiple threads.</p><p>Also both paradigms do not offer any security abut when the task or the job will be done in a certain point in time, making them really similar from a functional point of view.</p><p>According to the X86 memory model, why the majority of people suggest to use concurrency with C++ and not just an async approach ? Also why not considering the worst case scenario of a computer where the context switch is probably more expensive than the computation itself ?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p><strong>You have multiple cores/procesors, <em>use</em> them</strong></p><p>Async <em>is</em> best for doing heavy IO bound processing but what about heavy CPU bound processing?</p><p>The problem arises when single-threaded code blocks (ie gets stuck) on a long-running process. For instance, remember back when printing a word processor document would make the whole application freeze until the job was sent? Application freezing is a side-effect of a single-threaded application blocking during a CPU-intensive task.</p><p>In a multi-threaded application, CPU-intensive tasks (ex a print job) can be sent to a background worker thread thereby freeing up the UI thread.</p><p>Likewise, in a multi-process application the job can be sent via messaging (ex IPC, sockets, etc) to a subprocess designed specifically to process jobs.</p><p>In practice, async <em>and</em> multi-threaded/process code each have their benefits and drawbacks.</p><p>You can see the trend in the major cloud platforms, as they will offer instances specialized for CPU bound processing and instances specialized for IO bound processing.</p><p><em>Examples:</em></p><ul><li>Storage (ex Amazon S3, Google Cloud Drive) is CPU bound</li><li>Web Servers are IO bound (Amazon EC2, Google App Engine)</li><li>Databases are both, CPU bound for writes/indexing and IO bound for reads</li></ul><p><strong>To put it into perspective...</strong></p><p>A webserver is a perfect example of a platform that is strongly IO bound. A multi-threaded webserver that assigns one thread per connection doesn&#39;t scale well because every thread incurs more overhead due to the increased amount of context switching and thread locking on shared resources. Whereas an async webserver would use a single address space.</p><p>Likewise, an application specialized for encoding video would work much better in a multi-threaded environment because the heavy processing involved would lock the main thread until the work was done. There are ways to mitigate this but it&#39;s much easier to have a single thread managing a queue, a second thread managing cleanup, and a pool of threads managing the heavy processing. Communication between threads happens only when tasks are assigned/completed so thread-locking overhead is kept to a bare minimum.</p><p>The best application often uses a combination of both. A webapp, for instance may use nginx (ie async single-threaded) as a load balancer to manage the torrent of incoming requests, a similar async webserver (ex Node.js) to handle http requests, and a set of multi-threaded servers handle uploading/streaming/encoding content, etc...</p><p>There have been a lot of religious wars over the years between multi-threaded, multi-process, and async models. As with the most things the best answer really should be, &#34;it depends.&#34;</p><p>It follows a the same line of thinking that justifies using GPU and CPU architectures in parallel. Two specialized systems running in concert can have a much greater improvement than a single monolithic approach.</p><p>Neither are better because both have their uses. Use the best tool for the job.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p>I removed the reference to Apache and made a minor correction. Apache uses a multiprocess model which forks a process for every request increasing the amount of context switching at the kernel level. In addition, since the memory can&#39;t be shared across processes, each request incurs an additional memory cost.</p><p>Multi-threading gets around requiring additional memory because it relies on a shared memory between threads. Shared memory removes the additional memory overhead but still incurs the penalty of increased context switching. In addition -- to ensure that race conditions don&#39;t happen -- thread locks (that ensure exclusive access to only one thread at a time) are required for any resources that are shared across threads.</p><p>It&#39;s funny that you say, &#34;programmers seems to love concurrency and multi-threaded programs in general.&#34; Multi-threaded programming is universally dreaded by anybody who has done any substantial amount of it in their time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dead locks</a> (a bug that happens when a resource is mistakenly locked by two different sources blocking both from ever finishing) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">race conditions</a> (where the program will mistakenly output the wrong result randomly due to incorrect sequencing) are some of the most difficult to track down and fix.</p><p><strong>Update2:</strong></p><p>Contrary to the blanket statement about IPC being faster than network (ie socket) communications. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1235958/290340">That&#39;s not always the case</a>. Keep in mind that these are generalizations and implementation-specific details may have a huge impact on the result.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
