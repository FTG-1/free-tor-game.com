I&#39;ve added bits and snippets of each to HTML pages but I&#39;ve mostly coded server-side stuff in other languages. I&#39;ve noticed that while you can theoretically do the same things using either of the two approaches (and of course you can even mix &#39;em up in the same project) there seems to be a tendency to always start using JQuery from the very beginning no-matter what the project demands are.</p><p>So I&#39;m simply wondering, are there any punctual benefits to not use JQuery-only but instead to just use plain old JavaScript?</p><p>I know this looks like a non-question because it can be said about it that &#34;there&#39;s no definite answer&#34; or &#34;it can be debated for ever&#34;, but I&#39;m actually hoping for punctual answers such as &#34;You can do this in one approach and you cannot do it with the other&#34;.</p><hr/><p>As per scrwtp&#39;s comment, I&#39;m not referring just to the DOM Handling part. My question is rather: JQuery is a library. For Javascript. What I find strange about this library as opposed to other libraries for other languages is that in JQyery&#39;s case it seems to be designed to be able to use it exclusively and not need to touch Javascript directly. This is as opposed to let&#39;s say Hibernate and SQL, where even though the library (or rather framework in this case, but I think the analogy still applies) takes the handle on A LOT of aspects, you still get to use SQL when using it, at least for some fringe cases. However in JQuery &amp; Javascript case, you could do anything you do with Javascript using only JQuery (or at least that&#39;s how it seems to me).</p><hr/><p>As per Stargazer712&#39;s comment: yes, I agree with you, the question here is, as you put it &#34;just a matter of how you will be using JavaScript&#34;. That&#39;s what I was actually thriving to ask, but I&#39;ve made some bad formulations. Here&#39;s another analogy: <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/expressions.html">Spring Expression Language</a>. It&#39;s a Java library. You can&#39;t use it without Java, it&#39;s based on Java, and down through it all you still get to use Java. But in practice what you can do is add this library to a Java project, and then write all your code using Spring EL&#39;s expression language which effectively makes your code not resemble Java at all, and it&#39;s even paradigm shifting (for example you no longer have strong type enforcement when using this). While I do understand that JQuery is just a JS library, to me it seems that in practice it has the same effect as Spring EL has with Java, i.e you can only use it&#39;s APIs through out a project and avoid JavaScript&#39;s APIs. And I was wondering if that&#39;s a good thing to do, what might be the pitfalls etc.</p><p>(and yes, after reading everyone&#39;s answers I do understand that :</p><p>a. my question is somewhat non-sensical up to a point</p><p>b. even if the question were completly accurate, the answer to it would be pretty much &#34;no you can&#39;t just use JQuery-only all the time)</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>First off - it&#39;s impossible to use jQuery only, all jQuery does is add a $ object to your global scope, with a bunch of methods in it. Even more manipulative libraries like prototype aren&#39;t an <em>alternative</em> to javascript, they&#39;re a toolbelt to solve common problems.</p><p>The main advantages to adding jQuery to your toolbelt would be:</p><ul><li>browser compatibility - doing something like .attr() is much easier than the native alternatives, and won&#39;t break across browsers.</li><li>simplification of usually complicated operations - if you&#39;d like to see a well written cross browser compatible version of an XHR method, take a look at the source for $.ajax - for this method alone it&#39;s almost worth the overhead of jQ.</li><li>DOM selection - simple things like binding events &amp; selecting DOM elements can be complicated and differ per-browser. Without a lot of knowledge, they can also be easily written poorly and slow down your page.</li><li>Access to future features - things like .indexOf and .bind are native javascript, but not yet supported by many browsers. However, using the jQuery versions of these methods will allow you to support them cross browser.</li></ul><p>Javascript is no longer just a client side language, and because jQuery is so DOM dependent, it is a terrible candidate to move to the server. I highly recommend putting some time into understanding <strong>why</strong> you are using jQuery (asking this question is a great first step!), and evaluating when it is necessary. jQuery can be dangerous, a few of the main dangers are:</p><ul><li>code quality - jQuery has a huge community and a low learning curve. This is a perfect storm for lots of poorly written open source plugins.</li><li>inefficiency - jQuery is easy to write inefficiently. For instance, using jQuery&#39;s each instead of for loops is unnecessary and could have a performance impact in some cases. Lots of good info about this stuff at <a href="http://jsperf.com/">JSPerf</a></li><li>bloat - jQuery is a huge library. Much of the time, you&#39;ll use a small subset of it&#39;s features, and grab the whole library. There are some great alternatives that will give you subsets of the features, like zepto.js, and underscore.js - depending on your situation, you can save some bytes by choosing the right library for your needs.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, jQuery is an incredibly useful and helpful library, when used properly. However, it is <strong>not</strong> an alternative to javascript. It is a library, just like <a href="http://www.zeptojs.com/">zepto.js</a>, <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a>, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a>, and <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> - one of which may be a much better choice for your current project.</p><p>Javascript is a misunderstood language, and is only recently being regarded as something more than a scripting language by most people. I really recommend reading up on it more, here&#39;s a few good places to start:</p><p><em>Edit 07/2014 - I noticed this post is still getting attention, so I added a bunch of links.
