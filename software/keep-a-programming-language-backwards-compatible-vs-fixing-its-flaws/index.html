If and when there&#39;s something wrong in a language, developers either avoid it (if they can) or they learn to live with it.</p><p>Now, the developers of those languages get a lot of feedback from the programmers that use them. So it kind of makes sense that, as time (and version numbers) goes by, the problems in those languages will slowly but surely go away. Well, not really. Why? Backwards compatibility, that&#39;s why. But why is this so? Read below for a more concrete situation.</p><hr/><p>The best way I can explain my question is to use PHP as an example:</p><p>PHP is loved, and hated by thousands of people. All languages have flaws, but apparently PHP is special. Check out <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>. It has a very long list of so called flaws in PHP. Now, I&#39;m not a PHP developer (not yet), but I read through all of it and I&#39;m sure that a big chunk of that list are indeed real issues. (Not all of it, since it&#39;s potentially subjective).</p><p>Now, if I was one of the guys who actively develops PHP, I would surely want to fix those problems, one by one. However, if I do that, then code that relies on a particular behavior of the language will break if it runs on the new version. Summing it up in 2 words: backwards compatibility.</p><p>What I don&#39;t understand is: why should I keep PHP backwards compatible? If I release PHP version 8 with all those problems fixed, can&#39;t I just put a big warning on it saying: &#34;Don&#39;t run old code on this version !&#34;?</p><p>There is a thing called deprecation. We had it for years and it works. In the context of PHP: look at how these days people actively discourage the use of the <code>mysql_*</code> functions (and instead recommend <code>mysqli_*</code> and PDO). Deprecation works. We can use it. We should use it. If it works for functions, why shouldn&#39;t it work for entire languages?</p><p>Let&#39;s say I (the developer of PHP) do this:</p><ul><li>Launch a new version of PHP (let&#39;s say 8) with all of those flaws fixed</li><li>New projects will start using that version, since it&#39;s much better, clearer, more secure etc.</li><li>However, in order not to abandon older versions of PHP, I keep releasing updates to it, fixing security issues, bugs etc. This makes sense for reasons that I&#39;m not listing here. It&#39;s common practice: look for example at how Oracle kept updating version 5.1.x of MySQL, even though it mostly focused on version 5.5.x.</li><li>After about 3 or 4 years, I stop updating old versions of PHP and leave them to die. This is fine, since in those 3 or 4 years, most projects will have switched to PHP 8 anyway.</li></ul><p>My question is: <strong>Do all these steps make sense? Would it be so hard to do? If it can be done, then why isn&#39;t it done?</strong></p><p>Yes, the downside is that you break backwards compatibility. But isn&#39;t that a price worth paying ? As an upside, in 3 or 4 years you&#39;ll have a language that has 90 % of its problems fixed&#8230;. a language much more pleasant to work with. Its name will ensure its popularity.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: OK, so I didn&#39;t expressed myself correctly when I said that in 3 or 4 years people will move to the hypothetical PHP 8. What I meant was: in 3 or 4 years, people will use PHP 8 if they start a new project.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>It sounds fine, but rarely works out in practice; people are extremely reluctant to change running code, and even for new, green-field projects they are very reluctant to switch way from a language/version that they already know.</p><p>Changing existing, running code that &#34;works fine&#34; is not something that ranks high on any project&#39;s priority list. Rather than applying effort to things that the managers thought had been paid for already, just to be able to upgrade to a newer release of a language or platform, they will decree that the developers should just stay on the old release &#34;for now&#34;. You can try to entice your users with great features only available in the new release, but it&#39;s a gamble where you risk decreasing your user base for no clear gain for the language; cool, modern features cannot easily be weighed against the price of fragmented installation base in popular opinion, and you run the risk of getting a reputation for being an &#34;upgrade treadmill&#34; that requires constant effort to keep running when compared to more relaxed languages/platforms.</p><p>(Obviously, most of this doesn&#39;t apply to projects written by hobbyists just for their own pleasure. However (here be flamebait...) PHP is disproportionally rarely chosen by hackers because it&#39;s such a pleasure to write with in the first place.)</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
