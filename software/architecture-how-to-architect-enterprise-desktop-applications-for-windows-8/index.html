Create a new Metro-based UI on top of WinRT, deploy it to your customer via the Marketplace, and everyone wins.  Seems simple enough.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m not in that business.</p><p>I work on internal, line-of-business applications for a large enterprise.  We currently use .NET technologies such as WPF and Silverlight in order to create rich UIs that can be easily deployed to our users via the web or ClickOnce.  The applications can support WinXP and Win7 without too much headache, and our developers get to use XAML which is a very solid UI technology.</p><p>It seems like WPF and Silverlight have questionable futures at this point, so it is a bit worrisome to continue investing in those.  But a Metro UI doesn&#39;t seem appropriate for enterprise applications, and the WinRT API is quite limiting with regards to &#34;typical&#34; things that enterprise applications need to do.</p><p><strong>How should I be architecting my XAML-based applications, currently being deployed to WinXP and Win7, so that they will be supportable and evolvable on Win8?</strong></p><p>Assume for the purposes of this question that the features provided by HTML5 on top of ASP.NET are not adequate for the applications I&#39;m looking to create.  I understand that I can use HTML5 for some applications, but I&#39;m trying to figure out what I should do when that isn&#39;t enough.</p><p><strong>Edit #1:</strong><br /> This is in response to @Emmad Kareem&#39;s comment.  I do agree that Silverlight/WPF are viable in the short term (2-5 years).  However, the applications we produce have potentially very long lifetimes (10-20+ years).  So survivability in the long term for a given technology is a concern for us.  Also, we have some concern that it will be more and more difficult to find developers that are interested in Silverlight / WPF development if those technologies are considered &#34;dead&#34; by the community.  I just want to understand my options and make a decision with my eyes open.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p><strong>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the MS-Stack</strong></p><p>You can still run <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4221661/vb6-running-on-windows-8">VB6 apps on windows 8</a>.

 tea leaves to figure out the future direction of Microsoft. People get
 worried about .NET and decide to rewrite their whole architecture for
 .NET because they think they have to. Microsoft is shooting at you,
 and it&#39;s just cover fire so that they can move forward and you can&#39;t,
 because this is how the game is played, Bubby. Are you going to
 support Hailstorm? SOAP? RDF? Are you supporting it because your
 customers need it, or because someone is firing at you and you feel
 like you have to respond? The sales teams of the big companies
 understand cover fire.</p></blockquote><p>And that was written nearly ten years ago.</p><p><strong>Architecture and Technologies</strong></p><p>Architecture and Technologies are two separate things and choices to do :</p><ul><li>You can do <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/955973/looking-for-clean-winforms-mvc-tutorial-for-c-sharp">MVC with winforms</a>.</li><li>You can do <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MVVM with WPF/Silverlight</a>.</li><li>You can do <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MVC with ASP.NET</a>.</li><li>You can do <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/content/content/140554/windows8-platform-tools_2.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">whatever you want, including MVC and MVVM, with WINRT as far as we know</a>.</li><li>You can go functional with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F#</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Use_in_industry" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Why not ? There are domains where it would make sense.</a></li><li>You can mix all of them, to have different entry points to a common system, then <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/19457/review-microsoft-n-layer-app-sample-part-i" rel="nofollow noreferrer">be mocked because it gets too complicated</a>, etc.</li></ul><p>You can use services, resources, third party controls, ORMs, etc. with all this technologies, and maybe, or maybe not, with the next ones.</p><p>You can twist and bend MVC in many ways with all those technologies : Binding or not ? code behind view or not ? Controller or not ? ViewModel everytime or only when needed ? There are so many ways to implement a design pattern, even within the scope of one specific technology.</p><p>That would be irrealistic to force you into one of them without advanced knowledge of your project and team. It would only be based on personal preferences, and would end-up in a &#34;my technology is better than yours&#34; showdown.</p><p>The only thing that can be honestly and objectively suggested is to use the best practices you can apply to create an architecture that will stand the test of time, and maybe, really maybe will be portable or reused at least in parts with a future unknown technology. And that upgradability/portability shouldn&#39;t even be the main purpose of your architecture.</p><p><strong><em>The main purpose of your architecture and choosed technology is to deliver a product to your boss/customer that meets his realistic requirements.</em></strong></p><p>MVC (and it&#39;s younger brother MVVM) proved more and more to be a basis for robust architecture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller" rel="nofollow noreferrer">since 1979</a> in the OOP languages arena and beyond. But choosing what specific technology should be used in a 10 years long project should remain your decision.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
