These are of course always a matter of debate but there&#39;s at least some core concepts that most programmers find agreeable. Naming your variables appropriately, naming in general, making your lines not outrageously long, avoiding long functions, encapsulations, those things.</p><p>However, there&#39;s a problem that I have yet to find anyone commenting on and that just might be the biggest one of the bunch. It&#39;s the problem of arguments being anonymous when you call a function.</p><p>Functions stem from mathematics where f(x) has a clear meaning because a function has a much more rigorous definition that it usually does in programming. Pure functions in mathematics can do a lot less than they can in programming and they are a much more elegant tool, they usually only take one argument (which is usually a number) and they always return one value (also usually a number). If a function takes multiple arguments, they are almost always just extra dimensions of the function&#39;s domain. In other words, one argument isn&#39;t more important than the others. They are explicitly ordered, sure, but other than that, they have no semantic ordering.</p><p>In programming however, we have more freedom defining functions, and in this case I&#39;d argue it isn&#39;t a good thing. A common situation, you have a function defined like this</p><pre><code>func DrawRectangleClipped (rectToDraw, fillColor, clippingRect) {}
</code></pre><p>Looking at the definition, if the function is written correctly, its perfectly clear what&#39;s what. When calling the function, you might even have some intellisense/code completion magic going on in your IDE/editor that will tell you what the next argument should be. But wait. If I need that when I&#39;m actually writing the call, isn&#39;t there something we&#39;re missing here? The person reading the code doesn&#39;t have the benefit of an IDE and unless they jump to the definition, they have no idea which of the two rectangles passed as arguments is used for what.</p><p>The problem goes even further than that. If our arguments come from some local variable, there might be situations where we don&#39;t even know what the second argument is since we only see the variable name. Take for example this line of code</p><pre><code>DrawRectangleClipped(deserializedArray[0], deserializedArray[1], deserializedArray[2])
</code></pre><p>This is alleviated to various extents in different languages but even in strictly typed languages and even if you name your variables sensibly, you don&#39;t even mention the type the variable is when you&#39;re passing it to the function.</p><p>As it usually is with programming, there are a lot of potential solutions to this problem. Many are already implemented in popular languages. Named parameters in C# for example. However, all that I know have significant drawbacks. Naming every parameter on every function call can&#39;t possibly lead to readable code. It almost feels like maybe we&#39;re outgrowing possibilities that plain text programming gives us. We&#39;ve moved from JUST text in almost every area, yet we still code the same. More information is needed to be displayed in the code? Add more text.<br /> Anyways, this is getting a bit tangential so I&#39;ll stop here.</p><p>One reply I got to the second code snippet is that you would probably first unpack the array to some named variables and then use those but the variable&#39;s name can mean many things and the way it&#39;s called doesn&#39;t necessarily tell you the way it&#39;s supposed to be interpreted in the context of the called function.<br /> In the local scope, you might have two rectangles named leftRectangle and rightRectangle because that&#39;s what they semantically represent, but it doesn&#39;t need to extend to what they represent when given to a function.</p><p>In fact, if your variables are named in the context of the called function than you&#39;re introducing less information than you potentially could with that function call and on some level if does lead to code worse code. If you have a procedure that results in a rectangle you store in rectForClipping and then another procedure that provides rectForDrawing, then the actual call to DrawRectangleClipped is just ceremony. A line that means nothing new and is there just so the computer knows what exactly you want even though you&#39;ve explained it already with your naming. This isn&#39;t a good thing.</p><p>I&#39;d really love to hear fresh perspectives on this. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the first one to consider this a problem, so how is it solved?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>I agree that the way functions are often used can be a confusing part of writing code, and especially reading code.</p><p>The answer to this problem partly depends on the language. As you mentioned, C# has named parameters. Objective-C&#39;s solution to this problem involves more descriptive method names. For example, <code>stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:</code> is a method with clear parameters.</p><p>In Groovy, some functions take maps, allowing for a syntax like the following:</p><pre><code>restClient.post(path: &#39;path/to/somewhere&#39;,
            body: requestBody,
            requestContentType: &#39;application/json&#39;)
</code></pre><p>In general, you can solve this issue by limiting the number of parameters you pass to a function. I think 2-3 is a good limit. If it appears that a function needs more parameters, it causes me to re-think the design. But, this can be harder to answer generally. Sometimes you are trying to do too much in a function. Sometimes it makes sense to consider a class for storing your parameters. Also, in practice, I often find that functions which take large numbers of parameters normally have many of them as optional.</p><p>Even in a language like Objective-C it makes sense to limit the number of parameters. One reason is that many parameters are optional. For an example, see rangeOfString: and its variations in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html" rel="nofollow">NSString</a>.</p><p>A pattern I often use in Java is to use a fluent-style class as a parameter. For example:</p><pre><code>something.draw(new Box().withHeight(5).withWidth(20))
</code></pre><p>This uses a class as a parameter, and with a fluent-style class, makes for easily readable code.</p><p>The above Java snippet also helps where the ordering of parameters may not be so obvious. We normally assume with coordinates that X comes before Y. And I normally see height before width as a convention, but that is still not very clear (<code>something.draw(5, 20)</code>).</p><p>I&#39;ve also seen some functions like <code>drawWithHeightAndWidth(5, 20)</code> but even these can&#39;t take too many parameters, or you&#39;d start to lose readability.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
