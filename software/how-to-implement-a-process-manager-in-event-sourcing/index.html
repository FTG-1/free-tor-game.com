I have a <code>Basket</code> aggregate and a <code>Product</code> aggregate which should work independently.</p><p>Here&#39;s some pseudo code to show the implementation</p><pre><code>Basket { BasketId; OrderLines; Address; }

// basket events
BasketCreated { BasketId; }
ItemAdded { BasketId; ProductId; Quantity }
AddItemSucceeded { BasketId; ProductId; Quantity }
AddItemRevoked { BasketId; ProductId; Quantity }
ItemRemoved { BasketId; ProductId; Quantity }
CheckedOut { BasketId; Address }

Product { ProductId; Name; Price; }

// product events
ProductReserved { ProductId; Quantity }
ProductReservationFailed { ProductId; Quantity }
ProductReservationCancelled { ProductId; Quantity; }
</code></pre><p>Commands are pretty similar to the events, using the imperative name and not past tense.</p><p>Right now these work just fine independently. I issue a command <code>AddItem</code>, and it creates a <code>ItemAdded</code> event on the <code>Basket</code> aggregate which does what it needs to do with the state of the &#39;Basket&#39;. Similarly, for product the command and events work just fine.</p><p>I&#39;d now like to combine this into a process which would go something like this (in terms of commands and events that happen):</p><p>The process manager would do the following:</p><pre><code>on BasketCreated: CreateShoppingProcess
on ItemAdded: ReserveProduct
on ProductReserved: SucceedAddingItem // does nothing, but needs to be there so that the basket knows it can check out
on ProductReservationFailed: RevokeAddItem
on RemoveItem: CancelProductReservation
on Checkout: CreateOrder // create an order and so on...
</code></pre><p>The questions that I couldn&#39;t find definitive answers to are:</p><ol><li>Do I need to persist the process manager? It seems like I do, but I&#39;m not sure</li><li>If I do, I need to save the events for the process manager. However, the events that It&#39;s listening to are tied to the aggregates. Do I add the process id to those? Do I have separate events just for the process manager? How to do this and keep as DRY as possible</li><li>How do I know what basket the <code>ProductReserved</code> events are for? Is it OK to have a <code>BasketId</code> on those too, or is that leaking info?</li><li>How do I keep a relationship between events, how do I know which <code>ItemAdded</code> produced which <code>ProductReserved</code> event? Do I pass along an <code>EventId</code>? This seems odd&#8230;</li><li>Should I implement the <code>Basket</code> as a process manager instead of a simple aggregate?</li></ol><p>After some more research I came to this:<br /> A Saga is something that keeps its own events and listens to events from the outside. Basically, it&#39;s an Aggregate that can also react to events happening outside it&#39;s own little world.</p><p>A Process Manager works with the events from the outside and sends out commands. It&#39;s history can be rebuilt from the events that have happened on the Aggregates which share a common identifier like a correlationId.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Review what Rinat Abdullin wrote about <a href="https://abdullin.com/post/ddd-evolving-business-processes-a-la-lokad/" rel="noreferrer">evolving business process</a>.  In particular, notice his recommendation for developing a business process in a fast changing environment -- a process manager is &#34;just&#34; an automated replacement for a human being staring at a screen.</p><p>My own mental model of a process manager is that it is an event sourced projection that you can query for a list of pending commands.</p><blockquote><p>Do I need to persist the process manager? It seems like I do, but I&#39;m not sure</p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s a read model.  You can rebuild the process manager from the history of events each time you need it; or you can treat it like a snapshot that you update.</p><blockquote><p>If I do, I need to save the events for the process manager.</p></blockquote><p>No - the process manager is a <em>manager</em>.  It doesn&#39;t do anything useful on its own; instead it tells aggregates to do work (ie, make changes to the book of record).</p><blockquote><p>How do I know what basket the ProductReserved events are for? Is it OK to have a BasketId on those too, or is that leaking info</p></blockquote><p>Sure. <em>Note:</em> in most &#34;real&#34; shopping domains, you wouldn&#39;t insist on reserving inventory before processing an order; it adds unnecessary contention to the business.  It&#39;s more likely that your business would want to accept the order, then apologize in the rare case that the order can&#39;t be fulfilled in the required time.</p><blockquote><p>How do I keep a relationship between events, how do I know which ItemAdded produced which ProductReserved event?</p></blockquote><p>Messages have meta data - in particular, you can include a causationIdentifier (so you can identify which commands produced which events) and a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CorrelationIdentifier.html" rel="noreferrer">correlationIdentifier</a>, to generally track the conversation.</p><p>For instance, the process manager writes its own id as the correlationId in the command; the events produced by a copy the correlation id of the command, and your process manager subscribes to all events that have its own correlationId.</p><blockquote><p>Should I implement the Basket as a process manager instead of a simple aggregate?</p></blockquote><p>My recommendation is no. <em>But</em> Udi Dahan has a different opinion that you should review; which is that <a href="http://udidahan.com/2011/04/22/when-to-avoid-cqrs/" rel="noreferrer">CQRS only makes sense if your aggregates are sagas</a> -- Udi used saga in the place where process manager has become the dominant spelling.</p><blockquote><p>should process managers retrieve aggregates?</p></blockquote><p>Not really?  Process managers are primarily concerned with orchestration, not domain state.  An instance of a process will have &#34;state&#34;, in the form of a history of all of the events that they have observed -- the correct thing to do in response to event Z depends on whether or not we have seen events X and Y.  So you may need to be able to store and load a representation of that state (which could be something flat, or could be the history of observed events).</p><p>(I say &#34;not really&#34; because <em>aggregate</em> is defined vaguely enough that it&#39;s not completely wrong to claim that list of observed events <em>is</em> an &#34;aggregate&#34;.  The differences are more semantic than implementation -- we load <em>process state</em> and then decide what messages to send to the parts of the system responsible for <em>domain state</em>.  There&#39;s a bit of hand waving going on here.)</p><blockquote><p>So the PM does not need to use one type of state management over another because it is only responsible for doing stuff live and never during replays?</p></blockquote><p>Not quite - state management isn&#39;t a do-er, it&#39;s a keeper tracker of-er.  In circumstances where the process manger shouldn&#39;t emit any signals, you give it inert connections to the world.  In other words, <code>dispatch(command)</code> is a no-op.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
