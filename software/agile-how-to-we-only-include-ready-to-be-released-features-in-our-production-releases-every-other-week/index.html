Every two weeks, we push a new version of our software to production.  Here&#39;s our current workflow:</p><ul><li>When starting a new task, developers create a &#34;feature branch&#34; off of the main development branch (we use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>) and work off this new branch</li><li>Once a developer has finished work on their task, they merge their feature branch back into the development branch</li><li>The developer merges the development branch into the QA branch.</li><li>A build is triggered off the QA branch.  The output of this build is deployed into our QA environment to allow the testers to begin their testing.</li></ul><p>It&#39;s quite common for our testers to find issues with these new features that have been merged into the QA branch.  This means that at any given time, the QA environment likely contains several new features &#8211; some tested and bug-free, and some broken.  This makes releasing difficult because it&#39;s rare that the QA build is in a production-ready state.</p><p>To mitigate this, we&#39;ve been trying to initiate a &#34;QA freeze&#34; which means developers don&#39;t merge our development branch into the QA branch a couple days before the release.  Bug fixes to the QA environment are made directly on the QA branch and merged down to the development branch.  Theoretically, this keeps new, broken features out of QA while still allowing us to fix issues already in QA.</p><p>While this &#34;QA freeze&#34; concept has been partially successful, it&#39;s hard to coordinate and people are often confused about whether they are allowed to merge to QA.  It&#39;s also been hard to set a &#34;QA freeze&#34; deadline &#8211; everyone likes the idea of some breathing room in between the freeze and the release, but in practice, they&#39;d rather have their feature in the next release than respect the deadline.</p><p><strong>Is there a better way to ensure that we have a clean build for our releases every other week?</strong></p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>There are a few problems floating around in this that are causing issues that you are experiencing.</p><p>The first is the long running QA branch.  Having a long running branch that is parallel to the development mainline may as a source of confusion because there are different efforts that need to be replicated in both the QA branch and the mainline.  This means that either you are checking in fixes to the QA branch that need to be merged to the mainline (not a bad thing), or you are checking in to the mainline that gets merged into the QA branch (a source of possible bugs).</p><p>The other problem with the long running parallel branch is that it is possible for files to become perpetually out of sync. A code fix that never gets merged back, or a configuration needed for production builds that is never tested and part of the development mainline.</p><p>Next, you&#39;ve got roles that are getting impinged on. This means that the packaging role (more on this later) is not getting sufficiently isolated.</p><p>In the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a> model, the release branch is branched from development (<em>not</em> development merged to QA) and all fixes are checked into the release branch and then merged back to the development branch.</p><p>Some of the philosophy of branching can be found in <a href="http://www.vance.com/steve/perforce/Branching_Strategies.html">Advanced SCM Branching Strategies</a> (I consider to be an excellent read).  This focuses on the roles that each branch may take on.  The release branch takes on the packing role.</p><blockquote><p>The packaging role is often confused with the accumulation or, more commonly, mainline roles. Once the intended development and maintenance have been performed and any accumulation has been done, it is time to prepare the code for release. Such an effort may not be trivial, requiring a team of release engineers and additional fixes beyond those already performed. The policy on a packaging branch is significantly different from that on a maintenance branch, as the packaging role suggests, only the changes necessary to make the product releasable should be addressed.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Branch from the development point to the release branch. The release branch that QA builds from gets one branch and no merges from development.<ul><li>If you want to go down that road, with consistent naming and hooks, it is possible to prevent a merge from being done into a release branch.</li></ul></li><li>Fix everything that needs to be fixed in the release branch and merge those changes back to the mainline.</li><li>At the end of the release effort, merge the release branch into the &#34;releases go here&#34; branch and tag it as such.<ul><li>Some sites don&#39;t have a &#34;releases go here&#34; branch and just leave the end of the release branch dangling with a tag.</li></ul></li></ul><p>One should seriously consider applying the entirety of git-flow in place. This isn&#39;t too far from what is being done currently and puts some discipline and consistency into what each branch means and how each branch interacts with others.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
