Due to the limited number of skilled people in GIS software development, and since I was among one of them I was directly recruited as a Project Manager.</p><p>I was quite conversant with Java and GIS, and I have done self motivated research on location based services, but not with project management and structured software development. It was one year after my graduation as a Geology special and during the previous year I was working as an academic in a University.</p><p>Thanks to the interest I was having at work, an opportunity shown up, and eventually I was made responsible for the Business Intelligence department of the company as well. The company believed in me. I myself studied data warehousing and BI concepts and was successful in combining GIS with BI as well.</p><p>Also I am currently working with two developers on our BI tool in C# WPF, where I also play the role of a developer at times (which I like).</p><p>I tried extremely hard to adopt good software development methodologies with agile project management, but it was not very successful. Also, though I believe in well designed code as far as a product is concerned, due to the lack of technical knowledge my CEO has (who is directly above me), I normally do not get the amount of time needed to do it. The time taken is greatly enhanced by the lack of expertise we have in the specific coding language as a whole too (for instance WPF opposed to Java). Also there is no version controlling system in place as well.</p><p>I am extremely fed up with the way things are going as it is not structured and I find most of my time thinking than working as to how to get things structured. I hope you guys with good professional experience will be able to help me overcome this situation.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>We had a similar problem (without the technical details, of course) in the company I work about two years ago.</p><p>You just need to do it one step at a time. Don&#39;t try to adopt the agile software development in a rush. There&#39;s a lot of stuff to learn and apply.
Don&#39;t let the lack of expertise to bring you down either.</p><p>Build slowly (but as fast as you can :P), steadily and surely.</p><p>I would recommend the next steps (to do this, you might switch from management to development for a while, but that should be fine)</p><ol><li>Learn a good <strong>version control system</strong>, and learn it well. Personally I would recommend git or mercurial. There is a lot of documentation on both.</li><li>Build a <strong>solid core</strong> on <strong>practices and patterns</strong>. Read books, read blogs, watch screencasts with the team members. This will give a new air to the development.</li><li>Learn <strong>TDD/BDD</strong> and try to apply it in the <strong>new code</strong>, as well as in the old code that you might touch when doing a new feature.</li><li>Do <strong>pair programming</strong>. Two heads think better than one, and also 4 eyes are better than 2 :).</li><li>Find about the <strong>latest</strong> and <strong>most common</strong> used <strong>tools</strong> in the community of the language you are currently developing. Learn about them and try to include some of them in the project. See how these were built and learn.</li><li>Use <strong>scrum</strong>. Iterations, stories, story points, impediments are all concepts you should get familiar with. For me, scrum has proven to be the best workflow for software development and management. Apply it and learn from each day experience.</li><li><strong>Teach by example</strong>. Most of beginner developers are eager to learn new stuff, but also some of them are very lazy. Anyways, show them the new stuff you&#39;ve been learning and applying and hopefully that will tickle their brains.</li></ol><p>Also, if possible, hire a consultant just so that he can check out the process and give better advice.</p><p>Don&#39;t get lazy or discouraged. Just learn from your mistakes and try different approaches.
