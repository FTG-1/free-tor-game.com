I don&#39;t think there is an absolute solution to this and this is one of the reasons why I&#39;m posting it here instead of Stack Overflow.</p><p>Over the last month I have been rewriting a fairly old piece of server code (mmorpg) to be more modern and easier to extend/mod.<br /> I started with the network portion and implemented a 3rd party library (libevent) to handle stuff for me.<br /> With all the re-factoring and code changes I introduced memory corruption somewhere and I have been struggling to find out where it happens.</p><p>I can&#39;t seem to reliably reproduce it on my dev/test environment, even when implementing primitive bots to simulate some load I don&#39;t get crashes any more (I fixed a libevent issue which caused some stuff)</p><p>I have tried so far:</p><p>Valgrinding the hell out of it &#8211; No invalid writes until the thing crashes (which may take 1+ day in production.. or just an hour) which is really baffling me, surely at some point it would access invalid memory and not overwrite stuff by chance? (Is there a way to &#34;spread out&#34; the address range?)</p><p>Code-Analysis tools, namely coverity and cppcheck. While they did point out some.. nastiness and edge cases in the code there was nothing serious.</p><p>Recording the process until it crashes with gdb (via undodb) and then working my way backwards. This /sounds/ like it should be doable, but I either end up crashing gdb by using the auto-complete feature or I end up in some internal libevent structure where I get lost since there&#39;s too many possible branches (one corruption causing another and so on).<br /> I guess it would be nice if I could see what a pointer originally belongs to/where it was allocated, that would eliminate most of the branching-issues. I cant run valgrind with undodb though, and I the normal gdb record is unusably slow (if that even works in combination with valgrind).</p><p>Code review! By myself (thoroughly) and having some friends look over my code, though I doubt it was thorough enough. I was thinking about maybe hiring a dev to do some code review/debugging with me, but I cant afford to put too much money in it and I wouldn&#39;t know where to look for someone who&#39;d be willing to work for little-to-no money if he doesn&#39;t find the issue or anyone qualified at all.</p><p>I should also note: I usually get consistent backtraces.<br /> There are a few places where the crash happens, mostly related to the socket class becoming corrupted somehow. Be it an invalid pointer pointing to something which isn&#39;t a socket or the socket class itself becoming overwritten (partially?) with gibberish. Although I suspect it&#39;s crashing there the most since that&#39;s one of the mostly used parts, so it&#39;s the first corrupted memory which gets used.</p><p>All in all this issue has had me busy for nearly 2 month (on and off, more of a hobby project) and is really frustrating me to the point where I become grumpy IRL and think about just giving up.<br /> I just can&#39;t think about what else I am supposed to do to find the issue.</p><p>Are there any useful techniques I missed?<br /> How do you  deal with that? (It can&#39;t be that common since there isn&#39;t much information about this.. or I&#39;m just really blind?)</p><p>Edit:</p><p>Some specs in case it matters:</p><p>Using c++(11) via gcc 4.7 (version supplied by debian wheezy)</p><p>The codebase is around 150k lines</p><p>Edit in response to david.pfx post: (sorry for the slow response)</p><blockquote><p>Are you keeping careful records of crashes, to look for patterns?</p></blockquote><p>Yes, I still have dumps of the recent crashes lying around</p><blockquote><p>Are the few places really similar? In what way?</p></blockquote><p>Well, in the most recent version (they seem to change whenever I add/remove code or change related structures) it would always get caught in an item timer method. Basically an item has a specific time after which it expires and it sends updated info to the client.<br /> The invalid socket pointer would be in the (still valid as far as I can tell) Player class, mostly related to that.<br /> I am also experiencing loads of crashes in the cleanup phase, after the normal shutdown where it&#39;s destroying all the static classes that haven&#39;t been explicitly destroyed (<code>__run_exit_handlers</code> in the backtrace). Mostly involving <code>std::map</code> of one class, guessing that&#39;s just the first thing that comes up though.</p><blockquote><p>What does the corrupt data look like? Zeros? Ascii? Patterns?</p></blockquote><p>I haven&#39;t found any patterns yet, seems somewhat random to me. It&#39;s hard to tell since I don&#39;t know where the corruption started.</p><blockquote><p>Is it heap-related?</p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s entirely heap-related (I enabled gcc&#39;s stack guard and that didn&#39;t catch anything).</p><blockquote><p>Does the corruption happen after a <code>free()</code>?</p></blockquote><p>You&#39;re going to have to elaborate a bit on that one.<br /> Do you mean having pointers of already free&#39;d objects lying around?<br /> I&#39;m setting every reference to null once the object gets destroyed, so unless I missed something somewhere, no. That should show up in valgrind though which it didn&#39;t.</p><blockquote><p>Is there something distinctive about the network traffic (buffer size, recovery cycle)?</p></blockquote><p>The network traffic consists of raw data. So char arrays, (u)intX_t or packed (to remove padding) structs for more complex things, each packet has a header consisting of an id and the packet size itself which is validated against the expected size.<br /> They are around 10-60bytes with the biggest (internal &#39;bootup&#39; packet, fired once at startup) having a size of a few Mb.</p><blockquote><p>Lots and lots of production asserts. Crash early and predictably before the damage propagates.</p></blockquote><p>I once had a crash related to <code>std::map</code> corruption, each entity has a map of it&#39;s &#34;view&#34;, each entity that can see it and vice versa is in that.<br /> I added a 200byte buffer in front and after, filled it with 0x33 and checked it before each access. The corruption just magically vanished, I must&#39;ve moved something around which made it corrupt something else.</p><blockquote><p>Strategic logging, so you know accurately what was happening just before. Add to the logging as you get closer to an answer.</p></blockquote><p>It works.. to an extend.</p><blockquote><p>In desperation, can you save state and auto-restart? I can think of a few pieces of production software that do that.</p></blockquote><p>I somewhat do that. The software consists of a main &#34;cache&#34; process and some other worker ones which all access the cache to get and save stuff. So per crash I don&#39;t lose much progress, it still disconnects all the users and so on, it&#39;s definitely not a solution.</p><blockquote><p>Concurrency: threading, race conditions, etc</p></blockquote><p>There&#39;s a mysql thread to do &#34;async&#34; queries, that&#39;s all untouched though and only shares information to the database class via functions with all lock.</p><blockquote><p>Interrupts</p></blockquote><p>There&#39;s an interrupt timer to prevent it from locking up that just aborts if it didn&#39;t complete a cycle for 30 seconds, that code should be safe though:</p><pre><code>if (!tics) {
    abort();
} else
    tics = 0;
</code></pre><p>tics is <code>volatile int tics = 0;</code> which is increased each time a cycle is completed. Old code too.</p><blockquote><p>events/callbacks/exceptions: corrupting state or the stack unpredictably</p></blockquote><p>Lots of callbacks are being used (async network I/O, timers), but they shouldn&#39;t do anything bad.</p><blockquote><p>Unusual data: unusual input data/timing/state</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;ve had a few edge cases related to that. Disconnecting a socket while packets are still being processed resulted in accessing a nullptr and such, but those have been easy to spot so far since every reference gets cleaned up right after telling the class itself it&#39;s done. (Destruction itself is handled by a loop deleting all the destroyed objects each cycle)</p><blockquote><p>Dependency on an asynchronous external process.</p></blockquote><p>Care to elaborate? This is somewhat the case, the cache process mentioned above.<br /> Only thing I could imagine off the top of my head would be it not finishing quick enough and using garbage data, but that&#39;s not the case since that&#39;s using network too. Same packet model.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>It&#39;s a challenging problem but I suspect there are a lot more clues to be found in the crashes you&#39;ve already seen.</p><ul><li>Are you keeping careful records of crashes, to look for patterns?</li><li>Are the few places really similar?
