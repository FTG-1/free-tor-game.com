</code></pre><p>We manage the source repository by git (<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy">https://github.com/sympy/sympy</a>), and thus each author owns the patches that he or she created. We then have an <code>AUTHORS</code> file where we list all the people who contributed patches (currently about ~450 or so). Typically authors fork the repository on github and add patches as git commits.</p><p>One author forked the repository, but added his name into the <code>LICENSE</code> file itself as a copyright notice as follows (I changed the name):</p><pre><code>Copyright (c) 2006-2015 SymPy Development Team,

</code></pre><p>The author developed a patch, that fixes a bug. The fix consists of touching just one file and removing 19 characters from one line, and adding 18 characters on another line in the same file. It also adds a 5 line test for this bug into a test file. That&#39;s it.</p><p>Under what conditions are we legally allowed to apply his patch (by cherry-picking his commits, e.g. preserving the date and author&#39;s name + email in the git meta data)?</p><p>a) Do we need to modify our <code>LICENSE</code> file to add his copyright notice?</p><p>b) Or are we still complying with the BSD license if we keep an up to date <code>AUTHORS</code> file and keep the git repository which specifically tracks which commits were contributed by which authors.</p><p>What I don&#39;t like about the option a) is that if all 450 or so contributors required this, then we would need to keep essentially the contents of the <code>AUTHORS</code> file in the <code>LICENSE</code> file, together with the <code>Copyright</code> word and the years. Git is much better at keeping the years (and even days and minutes) as well as which lines where modified by each author and how. Then we have a simple <code>LICENSE</code> file that doesn&#39;t change and we keep the list of authors in <code>AUTHORS</code> (and we have a script that keeps it synchronized with the list of authors from git).</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>You may incorporate any code that has a compatible license to it.</p><p>That said, unless the new code is specifically licensed under a compatible license if you are to pull the changes into your codebase, you are opening yourself up to the possibility of some difficulties.</p><p>In particular, unless the code specifically states that the <em>new</em> contributions are under a compatible license, the default &#34;all rights reserved&#34; license is applicable to it.  Pulling the code would be a copyright infringement.</p><p>There is also the possibility that the new code is licensed under a license that is compatible with you (and you would need to maintain that license for the code), but incompatible with many of your users.  For example, if you are using BSD 2 clause, and someone licenses the contributions of a fork under BSD 3 clause, you could probably pull that into your code without too much difficulty. However, as BSD 3 clause isn&#39;t compatible with the GPL, that would make your project GPL incompatible.</p><p>If you should decide change from BSD to GPL at a later time (for example), and the pull requests assign the necessary rights to change the license as part of the contributor license agreement, you pulling code from other projects that haven&#39;t agreed to the CLA could cause you some headaches.</p><p>Thats the general case...</p><p>For the specific case where the the license file changed... I don&#39;t know.  From the simple reading of the license file:</p><blockquote><pre><code>Copyright (c) 2006-2015 SymPy Development Team,

Fortunately, at this time you only have 450 people to ask.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
