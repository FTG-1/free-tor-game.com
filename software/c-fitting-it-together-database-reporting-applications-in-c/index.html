Within the past few weeks (I was actually going to write a blog post about this after I finished) I&#39;ve discovered that the barrier I&#39;m encountering is one that&#39;s actually quite common for newer developers.</p><p>This question is not so much about a specific thing as it is about piecing those things together.</p><p>I&#39;ve searched the internet far and wide, and found many tutorials on how to create applications that are <em>kind of</em> similar to what I&#39;m looking for. I&#39;ve also looked at hiring another, more experienced, developer to help me along, but all I&#39;ve gotten are unqualified candidates that don&#39;t have the experience necessary and won&#39;t take care of the client or project like I will. I&#39;d rather have the project never transpire than to release a solution that is half-baked.</p><p>I&#39;ve asked professors at my school, but they&#39;ve not turned up answers to my question. I&#39;m an experienced developer, and I&#39;ve written many applications that are &#8212; very abstractly &#8212; close to what I&#39;m doing, but my experiences from those applications aren&#39;t giving me enough leverage to solve this particular problem.</p><p>I just hope that posting this article isn&#39;t a mistake for me to write.</p><h2>Project Description</h2><p>I have a project I&#39;m working on for a client that is a rewrite of an application, originally written in Foxpro 2.6 by someone before me, that performs some analysis (which, sadly, I&#39;m not allowed to disclose as per of my employment contract) on financial data.</p><p>One day, after a long talk between the client and I &#8212; where he intimately described his frustrations with all the bugs I&#39;ve been hacking out of this code for 6 months now &#8212; he told me to just rewrite it and gave me a month to write a good 1/8 of this 65k LOC Foxpro monstrosity.  this 65k line of code foxpro monstrosity. It&#39;ll take me a good 3 &#8211; 6 months to rewrite this software (I know things the original programmer did not, like inheritance) going as I am right now, but I&#39;m quickly discovering that I&#39;m going to need to use databases.</p><p>Prior to this contract I didn&#39;t even know about foxpro, and so I&#39;ve had to learn foxpro on the fly, write procedures and make modifications to the database. I&#39;ve actually come to like it, and this project would be rewritten in Foxpro if it were still a supported language, because over the past few months, I&#39;ve come to like the features of Foxpro that make it so easy to develop data-driven applications.</p><p>I once perfomed an experiment, comparing C# to Foxpro. What took me 45 minutes in C# took me two in Foxpro, and I knew C# prior to Foxpro.</p><p>I was hoping to leverage the power of C#, but it intimidates me that in foxpro, you can have one line of code and be using a database.</p><p>Prior to this, I have never written any <em>serious</em> database development <em>from scratch</em>. All the applications that I&#39;ve written are in a different league. They are either completely data-naive or data-naive enough that I can get away with not using a database through serialization or by designing algorithms that work with the data in a manner that is stateless, so there is no need to worry about databases.</p><p>I&#39;ve come to realize, very quickly, that serialization and my efficacy with data structures has been my crutch all these years that&#39;s prevented me from adventuring into databases, and has consequently hindered my success in real-world programming.</p><p>Sure, I&#39;ve written some database stuff in Perl and Python, and I&#39;ve done forms and worked with <em>relational</em> databases and tables, I&#39;m a wizard in Access and Excel (seriously) and can do just about anything, but it just feels unnatural writing SQL code in another language&#8230;</p><p>I don&#39;t mind writing SQL, and I don&#39;t <em>It&#39;s that bridge between the database and the program code that drives me absolutely bonkers.</em> I hope I&#39;m not the only one to think this, but it bothers me that I have to create statements like the following</p><pre><code>string sSql =  &#34;SELECT * from tablename&#34;
</code></pre><p>When there&#39;s really no reason for that kind of unchecked language binding between two languages and two API&#39;s. Don&#39;t get my wrong, SQL is great, but I don&#39;t like the idea that, when executing commands on a SQL database, that one must intermix database and application software, and there&#39;s no database independence, which means that different versions of different databases can break code. This isn&#39;t very nice.</p><p>The nicest thing about Foxpro is the cohesiveness between programming language and database. It&#39;s so easy, and Foxpro makes it easy, because the tool just fits the task. I can see why so many developers have created a career with this language, because it lowered the barrier of entry to data-driven applications that so many businesses need. It was wonderful.</p><p>For my purposes today, with the demands and need for community support, extensibility, and language features, Foxpro isn&#39;t a solution that I feel would be the right tool for the job.</p><p>I&#39;m also worried about working too heavy with the database, because I&#39;ve seen data-driven .NET applications have issues with database caches, running out of memory, and objects in the database not being collected. (Memory leaks)</p><p><em>And OH the queries.</em></p><hr/><h2>Which one, how, and why?</h2><p>There are a plethora of different ways that a database can be setup, I think I counted 5 or 6 different kinds of database applications alone that I can chose from. That is a great mountain for me to climb when I don&#39;t even know where to begin when it comes to writing data-driven applications.</p><p>The problem isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t know SQL or that I don&#39;t know C#. I know both and have worked with both extensively. It&#39;s making them work together that&#39;s the problem, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never done in C# before.</p><h2>Reports</h2><p>The client likes paper. The data needs to be printed out in a format that is extensible, layered, and easy to use. I have never done reporting before, and so this is a bit of a problem. From the data source comes crystal reports, and so there&#39;s a dependency on the database, from what I understand.</p><h2>Code reuse</h2><p>A large part of the design decision that I&#39;ve gone through so far is to break the task of writing a piece of this software into routines and modular DLL&#39;s and so forth such that much of the code can be reused.</p><p>For example, when I setup this database, I want to be able to reuse the same database code over and over again.</p><p>I also want to make sure that when the day comes that another developer is here, that he/she will be able to pick up just where I left off.</p><p>The quicker I develop these applications, the better off I am.</p><h2>Tasks &amp; Goals</h2><p>In my project, I need to write routines that apply algorithms and look for predefined patterns in financial data. Additionally, I need to simulate trading based on predefined algorithms and data. Then I need to prepare reports on that data.</p><p>Additionally, I need to have a way to change the code base for this application quickly and effectively, without hacking together some band-aid solution for a problem that really needs a trauma ward.</p><h2>Special Considerations</h2><p>The solution must be fast, run quickly on existing hardware, and not be too much of a pain to maintain and write. I understand that anything I write I&#39;m married to &#8212; I&#39;m responsible for the things that I write because my reputation and livelihood is dependent on it.</p><p>Do I really need a database?</p><p>What about performance? Performance was such a big issue that I hand wrote a data structure that is capable of performing 2 billion operations, using a total of 4 gigs of memory in under 1/4 of a second using the standard core two duo processor. I could not find a similar, pre-written data structure in C# to perform this task.</p><p>What setup do I use in terms of database?</p><p>What about reporting? I&#39;d prefer to have PDF&#39;s generated, but I&#39;d like to be able to visually sketch those reports and then just have a ReportFactory of some sort, that when I pass some variables in, it just does that data.</p><h2>About Me</h2><p>I&#39;m a lone developer for a small business in this area. This is the first time I&#39;ve done this and I&#39;ve never had the breadth and depth of my knowledge tested.</p><p>I&#39;m incredibly frustrated with this project because I feel incredibly overwhelmed with the task at hand.</p><p>I&#39;m looking for that entry level point where I can draw a line and say &#34;this is what I need to do&#34;</p><h2> Conclusion</h2><p>I may have not been clear enough on my post. I&#39;m still new to this whole thing, and I&#39;ve been doing my best to contribute back to the community that I&#39;ve leached so much knowledge from. I&#39;d be glad to edit my post and add more information if possible.</p><p>I&#39;m looking for a big-picture solution or design process that helps me get off the ground in this world of data-driven applications, because I have a feeling that it&#39;s going to be concentric to my entire career as a programmer for some time.</p><p>Specifically, if you didn&#39;t get it from the rest of the post (I may not have been clear enough) I really need some guidance as to where to go in terms of the design decisions for this project. Some things that&#39;ll be useful will be a pro/con list for the different kinds of database projects available in VS2010. I&#39;ve tried, but generating that list has been as hard as solving the problem itself&#8230;</p><p><strong>If you could walk a developer writing a data-driven application for the first time in C#, how would you do that?
