While CVS and SVN and other traditional (i.e. centralized) version control system fulfill (mostly) the same purpose as modern (i.e. distributed) version control systems like mercurial and Git, you&#39;ll be much better off learning Git from the ground up instead of trying to transfer your SVN workflow to Git.</p><p><a href="http://hginit.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://hginit.com</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180923010353/http://hginit.com/" rel="noreferrer">view on archive.org</a>) by Joel Spolsky (one of the very founders of Stack Exchange) is a tutorial for mercurial, not Git, but it&#39;s zero-th chapter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180923010353/http://hginit.com/00.html" rel="noreferrer">&#34;Subversion Re-education&#34;</a> is useful for people switching away from SVN to <em>any</em> distributed version control system, as it tells you what SVN concepts you have to (temporarily) <strong>un</strong>-learn (or to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash" rel="noreferrer"><code>stash</code> away</a>, as Git users might say) to be able wrap your head around the distributed version control system concepts and the idiomatic workflows established to work with them.</p><p>So you can read that zero-th chapter and mostly just replace the word &#34;mercurial&#34; with &#34;Git&#34; and thereby properly prepare yourself and your mind for Git.</p><h3>The fine print</h3><p><em>(You might skip this for now.)</em> While mercurial and Git are much more similar to each other than to SVN, there <em>are</em> some conceptual differences between them, so some of the statements and advice in &#34;Subversion Re-education&#34; will become technically wrong when replacing &#34;mercurial&#34; with &#34;Git&#34;:</p><ul><li>While mercurial internally tracks and stores changesets, Git internally tracks and stores revisions (i.e. states of the content of a directory tree), just like Subversion does. <strong>But</strong> <em>other than Subversion</em> Git performs merges by looking at the differences between each involved branch respectively and a common ancestor revision (a true 3-point-merge), so the result is much the same as for mercurial: Merging is much easier and less error-prone than in SVN.</li><li>While you <em>can</em> branch in Git by cloning the repository (as is customary in mercurial), it&#39;s much more common to create a new branch within a Git repository. (That&#39;s because Git branches are simply (moving) pointers to revisions, whereas mercurial branches are permanent labels applied to every revision. These permanent labels are usually unwanted, so mercurial workflows usually work by cloning the complete repository for diverging development.)</li></ul><h1>In SVN, everything is a directory (but you shouldn&#39;t necessarily treat it as such)</h1><p>But I&#39;ve been interrupting you. You were saying?</p><blockquote><p>In SVN I usually checkout on my local machine a repo, which includes all branches in my project and I used to select the folder for my branch I am interested to and work there.</p></blockquote><p>If, by that, you mean you&#39;ve checked out the SVN repository&#39;s root folder (or any other folder corresponding to more than to <code>trunk</code> or to a single branch, e.g. in the conventional SVN repo layout the <code>branches</code> folder containing all non-trunk branches) then I dare say you&#39;ve probably used SVN wrong(ish), or at least abused a bit the fact that trunk, branches and tags are all folded into a single (though hierarchical) namespace together with directories <em>within</em> the revisions/codebase.</p><p>While it might be tempting to change several SVN branches in parallel, that is AFAIK not how SVN is intended to be used. (Though I&#39;m unsure about what specific downsides working like that might have.)</p><h1>In Git, only directories are directories</h1><p>Every clone of a Git repository is itself a Git repository: By default, it gets a full copy of the origin repository&#39;s history, including all revisions, branches and tags. But it will keep all that our of your way: Git stores it in a file-based database of sorts, located in the repository&#39;s root folder&#39;s hidden <code>.git/</code> subfolder.</p><p>But what are the non-hidden files you see in the repository folder?</p><p>When you <code>git clone</code> a repository, Git does several things. Roughly:</p><ol><li>It creates the <strong>target folder</strong>, and in it, the <code>.git/</code> subfolder with the &#34;database&#34;</li><li>It transfers the <strong>references</strong> (tags, branches etc.) of the origin repository&#39;s database and makes a copy of them in the new database, giving them a slighly modified name that marks them as &#34;remote&#34; references.</li><li>It transfers all the <strong>revisions</strong> (i.e. file tree states) that these references point to, as well all revisions that these revisions point to directly or transitively (their parents and ancestors) to the new database and stores them, so that the new remote references actually point to something that&#39;s available in the new repository.</li><li>It creates a local branch tracking the remote revision corresponding to the origin repository&#39;s default branch (usually <code>master</code>).</li><li>It checks out that local branch.</li></ol><p>That last step means that Git looks up the revision that this branch points at, and unpacks the file-tree stored there (the database uses some means of compression and de-duplication) into the repository&#39;s root folder. That root folder and all its subfolders (excluding the special <code>.git</code> subfolder) are known as your repository&#39;s &#34;working copy&#34;. That&#39;s where you interact with the content of the currently checked-out revision/branch. They&#39;re just normal folders and files. However, to interact with the repository per-se (the &#34;database&#34; of revisions and references) you use <code>git</code> commands.</p><h1>Seeing Git branches and interacting with Git branches</h1><blockquote><p>Currently I am cloning a repo and clone a specific branch using gitk.</p></blockquote><p>The version of <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk" rel="noreferrer"><code>gitk</code></a> I got cannot clone repositories. It can only view repo history and create branches and check out branches. Also, there&#39;s no &#34;cloning&#34; a branch. You can only clone repositories.</p><p>Did you mean you clone a repo using <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone" rel="noreferrer"><code>git clone ...</code></a> and then, using <code>gitk</code>, <strong>check out</strong> a branch?</p><blockquote><p>The project folder contains only the content for that branch and I cannot see all branches as in SVN, which is a little confusing for me.</p><p>[...]</p><ul><li>I would like to know if the git process I described is &#34;standard&#34; and some how correct [...]</li></ul></blockquote><p>Yes, that is pretty standard:</p><ul><li>Clone a repository using <code>git clone ...</code></li><li>Check out the branch you want to work on with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer"><code>git checkout ...</code></a> or using a graphical tool like <code>gikt</code></li></ul><blockquote><p>I cannot find an easy way to see all branches in my local repository using GIT.</p><ul><li>[...] or I am missing smt.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Maybe:</p><ul><li>you can list local branches with <code>git branch</code></li><li>you can list remote branches with <code>git branch -r</code> or all branches with <code>git branch -a</code></li><li><p>you can use <code>gitk</code> to view the complete history (all branches tags etc. that your local repo knows about) by invoking it with</p><pre><code>gitk --all
