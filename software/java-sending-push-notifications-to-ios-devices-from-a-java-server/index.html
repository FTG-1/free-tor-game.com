I have never done that in the past, so I went to tutorials and Apple documentation.</p><p><strong>1)</strong> The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/APNsProviderAPI.html" rel="nofollow">APN Provider API</a> claims that THE protocol to send push notifications from the server is HTTP/2. I failed to find any tutorials describing how to do so (I wanted those mostly as a sign that I&#39;m not the first one to do that and maybe for references to the most popular tools/libraries). I found several tutorials (<a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/123862/push-notifications-tutorial" rel="nofollow">Ray Wenderlich tutorial</a> probably being the most cited) that teach how to send push notifications using the binary protocol. Most GitHub projects use it as well (e.g. a &#34;push notification <a href="https://github.com/Ingibjorg/iOS-Push-Notifications-Simulator" rel="nofollow">simulator kit</a> from a Ray Wenderlich tutorial&#34;, a popular &#34;<a href="https://github.com/NicosKaralis/pushmeup" rel="nofollow">pushmeup</a>&#34; ruby gem, a very popular <a href="https://github.com/notnoop/java-apns" rel="nofollow">notnoop/java-apns</a> library and so on). Now, the Apple docs have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Appendixes/BinaryProviderAPI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH106-SW5" rel="nofollow">a section</a> for binary provider API which states that</p><blockquote><p>The legacy binary interface required your provider server to employ<br /> the binary API described in this appendix. All developers should<br /> migrate their remote notification provider servers to the more capable<br /> and more efficient HTTP/2-based API described in APNs Provider API.</p></blockquote><p>This definitely sounds like I shouldn&#39;t be using the binary API for new development&#8230; Even more so since the binary API requires usage (periodic polling) of a separate Feedback service for &#34;dead&#34; device tokens (or else you might be blocked they say), while the new HTTP/2 API gives this information as a response to each individual request, which looks like less moving parts.</p><p>As for the HTTP/2, there is a Java library <a href="https://github.com/CleverTap/apns-http2" rel="nofollow">CleverTap/apns-http2</a> which is even relatively popular, but it uses Jetty HTTP/2 client, and for it to work one <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/alpn-chapter.html" rel="nofollow">needs to start</a> JVM with an ALPN jar on the boot classpath, and that jar corresponds approximately <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/alpn-chapter.html#alpn-versions" rel="nofollow">1-to-1 with JDK versions</a> (which means that if your development uses 1.8.0u92 and your production uses 1.8.0u91 then there should be different jars put). That looks like a very brittle configuration to me in general and hard to apply in my case (each developer has his own VM + common dev VM + test server + prod) &#8212; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the effort to freeze one version on all of the machines and that these won&#39;t diverge with time; all I know is that all of them use JDK 8, but minor versions are out of my control. This need for the ALPN jar will be the case until JDK 9 is out (and adopted widely) which means 1+ year, and it is the case for Jetty and Netty and okhttp3 and I guess any Java library.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> As if this was not enough, there are also two authentication schemes described by the Apple docs: using a certificate (&#34;old style&#34;) vs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token" rel="nofollow">JWT</a>. The certificate approach is tried-and-true, but from the docs it looks like the certificate should be regenerated every year while JWTs don&#39;t (or to be more precise JWTs are regenerated every hour automatically and so that will be baked into the application and hopefully won&#39;t require any manual administrative actions that can be forgotten etc.). The only problem with JWT for me is that</p><blockquote><p>After you create the token, you must sign it with a private key as<br /> described in Creating a Universal Provider Token Signing Key in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582" rel="nofollow">App Distribution Guide</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The problem is that there is no such section or title or anything in that guide. Perhaps this step is very simple, but not having any hands-on experience with iOS security in particular and little experience with cryptography in general I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll miss something here. I can ask our iOS developers for help but I&#39;m not even sure this approach is mature enough if I can find zero working tutorials.</p><p>So, <strong>my questions</strong> finally are (pick any):</p><ul><li>Am I missing something and there is a way to follow Apple&#39;s guidelines and have the solution be reasonably simple?</li><li>How likely is it that the binary protocol will be terminated &#34;soon&#34;?</li><li>Should I choose the binary protocol or HTTP/2?</li><li>If it&#39;s the latter, should I pursue using JWT or is using a certificate more practical?</li><li>Maybe the situation (mostly with HTTP/2) is much better in some other languages/server platforms? I might even think about having a separate service just for sending iOS pushes done in that if that means jumping through less hoops.</li></ul><p>Thank you, sorry for the lengthy text.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>We have implemented several push servers and all of them following the <em>old tuple</em> &#34;socket-certificate&#34;.<em>In Java (1.5 - 1.7)</em>.</p><p>To work with certificates has some disadvantages. For instance, we need one for each environment (test, pro, etc). You have to be methodic at managing them or it&#39;s quite easy to end up with the wrong cert in pro. Or to forget its renewal (they also expire).</p><p>Related to the socket, this approach requires having opened a specific range of ports in the firewall.</p><p>Related to the whole protocol of communication. You get so little info after pushing messages. It&#39;s hard to figure out what happened with the messages. The only way is to retrieve messages from the queue of responses. A queue which orders is not guaranteed. Neither when APNS is going to put the responses onto it. It might not happen at all.</p><p>Compared to GCM (Google cloud message which runs via HTTP), the &#34;socket-cert&#34; of APNS is a pain in the ...</p><p><strong>My suggestion is to get focus on the HTTP 2 - JWT</strong> protocol. This is a very common implementation of security in client-server communications. You will find many more references about http2 and JWT than looking for APNS sockets and Certs.</p><p>Security via JWT is commonly implemented these days. There is full support from the community.</p><p>Moreover, If they have planned to drop the support to the current implementation, why even to dare to try it? Why spend time and money twice?</p><p>Be preventive. Implementing HTTP2 - JWT approach will save you from further code reviews and refactors. In any case, it&#39;s a work to do, so better have it done sooner than later.</p><p>Related to the library CleverTap. Well nobody is stopping you from implementing your own client! Suited to your need and requirements.</p><p>This has been our case with our current engine. We discarded all the 3rd party implementations and built our own. So far I know it keeps working perfectly... Till Apple drops the service.</p><p><em>(If we didn&#39;t move yet to HTTP2 - JWT is due to  time and money)</em></p><p>There&#39;s perhaps alternatives. Google Firebase Cloud Message is multi-platform. So you can push messages to Android and iOs devices from the same service. It works over HTTP and API keys (tokens). I suggest to you to take a look.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
