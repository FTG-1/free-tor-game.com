I&#39;ve seen at least three major points get a lot of discussion both on SE and elsewhere:</p><ul><li>What qualifies as a best practice, and why?</li><li>Are best practices even worth discussing in the first place, because it&#39;s reasonable to assert that no practice is a &#34;best&#34; practice?</li><li>When should you forego a best practice &#8212; or perhaps most best practices &#8212; either because it doesn&#39;t seem applicable or because of external constraints (time, money, etc.) that make the trade-off impractical?</li></ul><p>Something that seems to come up far less often, but more than never, is a notion of <strong>common sense</strong> in software development. Recent experience has brought this notion to the front of my mind again.</p><p>My initial impression is that it is a different discussion than best practices, but with perhaps some cross-pollination.</p><p>When I think of common sense in general, I think of a set of rules that you&#39;ve either picked up or been taught that give you a baseline to reason and make decisions. Following common sense is a good way to avoid you shooting your entire leg off. But beyond a pretty low baseline, common sense gives way to a need to make educated decisions, and educated decisions can even override common sense when the evidence seems compelling enough. I might be playing a little loose with the definition here, but I think it is close enough to spearhead my example.</p><p>When I think of common sense in software development, I think of all of the rules of basic hygiene to prevent a codebase from rapidly decaying into an incomprehensible mess. As examples, things like: not using a single global structure to maintain and communicate state within a non-trivial program; not using variables/method/class names that are just random gibberish; things that probably resemble what we&#39;ve come to call anti-patterns quite closely. Where applying best practices the practical analogue to learning patterns, applying common sense could be seen as the practical analogue of learning anti-patterns.</p><p>With this in mind, I&#39;d like to pose a few questions that seeing the answers of others for might help me reason my way through this.</p><p><strong>Do others believe that there is a notion of common sense in software development? Would be interested knowing the reasoning either way.</strong></p><p><strong>If so, is it a notion worth discussing? Is it something we should push for as much as we sometimes do with best practices? Is it something worth pushing for even harder?</strong></p><p>If the analogy to anti-patterns seems reasonable, the general rule is that anti-patterns are only employed if there is no other way, and even then only under very limited circumstances. <strong>How flexible should one be in allowing a codebase to deviate from common sense?</strong> It seems unreasonable that the answer is &#34;not at all,&#34; because sometimes expediency demands deviations. But, it seems like a different sort of argument than when to employ a &#34;best practice.&#34; Maybe it isn&#39;t; if you don&#39;t think so, I&#39;d like to learn why.</p><p>This is far more opened ended and maybe worthy of a follow-on question all its own, <strong>what sorts of recommendations would you point at that seem like matters of common sense?</strong></p><p>Other thoughts are also welcome.</p><hr/><p><sup>1</sup>Perhaps I would do better to call them &#34;commonly recurring domain patterns&#34;, but the name &#34;best practices&#34; is common enough that everyone knows what they are, even if they don&#39;t agree that they are. If the &#34;best&#34; part bothers you, just imagine I replaced &#34;best practices&#34; with something less authoritative sounding.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Best practices are practices that have been found to work well in a relatively wide field of circumstances. The problem with them is that A) the expression sometimes is abused for marketing and B) as fixed rules, they are not flexible enough; no set of fixed rules should be followed without thinking about whether they apply to the current situation.</p><p>Best practices are great when they come with explanations <em>why</em> they are &#34;best&#34; and in what circumstances they should be used. Then you can reason about when not to use them.</p><p>The problem with &#34;common sense&#34; is that it&#39;s <em>too</em> flexible - it can be used to justify pretty much anything, and you can&#39;t really have a rational discussion when people disagree and both claim their position is &#34;common sense&#34;. It&#39;s good to have but poor as a guideline for a team to follow.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
