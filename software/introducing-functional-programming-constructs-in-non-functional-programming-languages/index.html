I have only<br /> used OOP languages for my work (C++ and Java) but I am trying to learn some<br /> FP in my free time because I find it very interesting.</p><p>So, I started learning Haskell three years ago and Scala last summer. I plan to<br /> learn some SML and Caml as well, and to brush up my (little) knowledge of Scheme. Well, a lot of plans (too ambitious?) but I hope I will find the time<br /> to learn at least the basics of FP during the next few years.<br /> What is important for me is how functional programming works and how / whether<br /> I can use it for some real projects. I have already developed small tools in Haskell.</p><p>In spite of my strong interest for FP, I find it difficult to understand why<br /> functional programming constructs are being added to languages like C#, Java, C++, and so on. As a developer interested in FP, I find it more natural to<br /> use, say, Scala or Haskell, instead of waiting for the next FP feature<br /> to be added to my favourite non-FP language.<br /> In other words, why would I want to have only <strong>some</strong> FP in my originally<br /> non-FP language instead of looking for a language that has a better support<br /> for FP?</p><p>For example, why should I be interested to have lambdas in Java if I can switch<br /> to Scala where I have much more FP concepts and access all the Java libraries<br /> anyway?<br /> Similarly: why do <strong>some</strong> FP in C# instead of using F# (to my knowledge,<br /> C# and F# can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/478531/call-f-code-from-c-sharp">work together</a>)?</p><p>Java was designed to be OO. Fine. I can do OOP in Java (and I would like to keep using Java in that way). Scala was designed to support OOP + FP. Fine: I can use a mix of OOP and FP in Scala. Haskell was designed for FP: I can do FP in Haskell. If I need to tune the performance of a particular module, I can<br /> interface Haskell with some external routines in C.</p><p>But why would I want to do OOP with just <strong>some basic</strong> FP in Java?</p><p>So, my main point is: why are non-functional programming languages being extended with <strong>some</strong> functional concept?<br /> Shouldn&#39;t it be more comfortable (interesting, exciting, productive) to<br /> program in a language that has been designed from the very beginning to<br /> be functional or multi-paradigm? Don&#39;t different programming paradigms<br /> integrate better in a language that was designed for it than in a language<br /> in which one paradigm was only added later?</p><p>The first explanation I could think of is that, since FP is a new concept<br /> (it isn&#39;t new at all, but it is new for many developers), it needs to be<br /> introduced gradually. However, I remember my switch from imperative to OOP:<br /> when I started to program in C++ (coming from Pascal and C) I really had to<br /> rethink the way in which I was coding, and to do it pretty fast.<br /> It was not gradual. So, this does not seem to be a good explanation to me.</p><p>Or can it be that many non-FP programmers are not really interested in<br /> understanding and using functional programming, but they find it practically<br /> convenient to adopt certain <strong>FP-idioms</strong> in their non-FP language?</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong></p><p>Just in case (because I have seen several <em>language wars</em> on this site):<br /> I mentioned the languages I know better, this question is in no way<br /> meant to start comparisons between different programming<br /> languages to decide which is better / worse.</p><p>Also, I am not interested in a comparison of OOP versus FP (pros and cons).<br /> The point I am interested in is to understand why FP is being introduced<br /> one bit at a time into existing languages that were not designed for it<br /> even though there exist languages that were / are specifically designed<br /> to support FP.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Notwithstanding any specific ideas on the part of language designers, it bears mentioning that authors and stewards of programming languages are, in the end, pushing a product.  So, I might ask why I&#39;d want a camera-phone when my plain phone is a better phone and my camera a better camera, but that isn&#39;t going to stop manufacturers of both devices from trying to broaden their product&#39;s offering to attract new customers.</p><p>Once you look at it from that perspective, then notions of preserving the integrity of the original language become a matter of degrees and tradeoffs.  If I&#39;m the author of OOP language AwesomeCode and I see people starting to get interested in new functional language FCode, do I tell my users &#34;sorry, but this is an OOP language only&#34; and risk them going to C# instead to get at its lambas, or do I cave and grudgingly include some of FCode&#39;s functionality?</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
