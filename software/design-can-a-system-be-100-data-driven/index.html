We know it, most everyone knows it, but nobody is quite able to put his or her finger on the problem in a convincing way.</p><p>This story is about such an IT project, the most spectacular failure I
 have ever experienced. It resulted in the complete dismissal of a
 medium-sized IT department, and eventually led to the destruction of a
 growing company in a growing industry.  The company, which we&#39;ll call &#34;Upstart,&#34; was a successful and profitable subscription television business.</p><p>The project occurred in the early 1990s, and it was a custom-built
 order-entry and customer-service application, closely resembling what
 is now referred to as Customer-Relationship Management or CRM. The
 core functionality of the system included:</p><ul><li>Order entry and inventory</li><li>Customer service, help desk</li><li>General ledger, accounts receivable, billing, and accounts payable</li></ul><p>The application was
 called &#34;Vision&#34; and the name was both its officially stated promise
 for Upstart as well as a self-aggrandizing nod to its architect. The
 application was innovative, in that it was built to be flexible enough
 to accommodate any future changes to the business. Not just any
 foreseeable future changes to the business, but absolutely any changes
 to the business, in any form. It was quite a remarkable claim, but
 Vision was intended to be the last application ever built. It achieved
 this utter flexibility by <strong>being completely data-driven,</strong> providing
 limitless abstraction, and using object-oriented programming
 techniques that were cutting-edge at the time.</p><p>Like many such projects that set out to create a mission-critical
 application, the development effort spanned two years, about a year
 longer than originally projected. But that was acceptable, because
 this was the application that would last forever, adapting to any
 future requirements, providing unlimited Return On Investment (ROI).
 When the application finally went &#34;live,&#34; almost everybody in the
 company had invested so much in it that literally the fate of the
 company hinged on its success.</p><p>However, in the event of total project malfunction, mission-critical
 applications running the core business of multinational corporations
 are not permitted the luxury of the type of fast flameout demonstrated
 by thousands of &#34;dot-com&#34; companies in the era of the Internet bubble. Within a month of Vision going &#34;live,&#34; it was apparent to
 all but those most heavily vested in its construction that it was a
 failure.</p></blockquote><h3>See Also</h3><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect</a></p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
