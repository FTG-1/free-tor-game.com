For the purposes of this discussion, the UI of a native app does not usually consist of a full-screen webview only.</p><p><strong>Mobile web</strong><br/> This can in fact be any web page at all, however for this discussion let&#39;s consider a single-page web app which attempts to imitate the look and feel of a native app.  It is not a native app, it runs in the device&#39;s browser.</p><p><strong>Hybrid</strong><br/> Hybrid app <code>instanceof</code> native app.</p><p>Most people probably understand a hybrid app to be a single-page mobile web app (again most likely imitating the look and feel of a native app), but packaged as a native app with access to native services (Ã  la Phonegap).</p><p>However there is in fact a spectrum between the Phonegap model and fully native which I&#39;ll come to later.</p><h2>Mobile web</h2><p><strong>Technical restrictions</strong><br/> Let&#39;s first list some technical restrictions on mobile web apps which could in themselves be deal-breakers depending on what you&#39;re doing:</p><ul><li>HTML/canvas UI only</li><li>No access to certain device events and services (these are widely documented)</li><li>Cannot be listed in app stores (affecting discoverability)</li><li>Can become full screen and have homescreen icon on iOS, however this is an unusual and unfamiliar experience for most users</li></ul><p>If you can live with all the above, then read on for more about the challenges of single-page native-style web apps.  However this section wouldn&#39;t be complete without reference to the FT app.</p><p><strong>Financial Times</strong><br/> The <a href="http://apps.ft.com/ftwebapp/">FT web app</a> is a famous example of this style of app. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/appsblog/2013/apr/29/financial-times-html5-no-drawbacks">Here&#39;s an interesting feature from the UK Guardian newspaper about it.</a></p><p>It&#39;s certainly a remarkable feat of engineering.  Note that it is currently still only available on <strong>iOS only</strong> -- this tells me that they are finding that resolving the challenges of advanced cross-browser development to be very difficult indeed.</p><h2>Single-page native-style web apps</h2><p>This section applies to both mobile web and Phonegap-style apps.</p><p>Native-style look and feel within a web app is usually achieved with a framework such as <a href="http://www.sencha.com/">Sencha Touch</a> which provides a suite of UI components for you to use.</p><p>Such frameworks are fine for very simple UIs.  However they lack flexibility.  You won&#39;t be able to implement any native app design using Sencha, you&#39;ll need to adapt your design to what the framework can accommodate.</p><p>The main way in which these frameworks suffer is in trying to emulate the platform&#39;s own UI intricacies.  That nice little bouncing effect you get when you&#39;ve scrolled to the end of a list on the iPhone?  Your framework needs to emulate that in Javascript.  It&#39;s impossible to recreate it completely, it will be prone to slow down, and your users will be stuck in the the &#34;uncanny valley&#34; of an app which looks sort-of like native, but clearly isn&#39;t, and a non-technical user won&#39;t be able to put their finger on exactly why.</p><p><strong>The &#34;HTML5/Javascript is easy&#34; myth</strong></p><p>Device fragmentation within web browsers is rife, and when you get beyond the most basic HTML and CSS you&#39;ll notice things don&#39;t quite work as you&#39;d expect.  You might find yourself spending more time solving fiddly UI issues than you&#39;d have saved doing it natively twice over.  If you&#39;re going native, note that native app webviews are <em>not</em> the same as device browsers and have their own fragmentation issues.</p><p>And as your app gets more functionally complex, you&#39;ll find that you need more than basic jquery skills to keep your Javascript clean and maintainable.</p><p>That said, it&#39;s perfectly possible to create simple, functional apps pretty quickly with this approach.  But it&#39;s pretty obvious when an app is doing it.</p><h2>Further along the spectrum</h2><p>So, we want a better UX than Phonegap-style apps can offer, without writing absolutely everything from scratch multiple times.  What can we do?</p><p><strong>Share non-UI code</strong></p><p>There are a range of techniques available for sharing business logic across multiple native platforms.  Google have launched <a href="https://code.google.com/p/j2objc/">J2ObjC</a> which translates Java into Objective-C.  With careful factoring of code, a Java library could be used on both Android and iOS.</p><p>Libraries such as <a href="http://calatrava.github.io/">Calatrava</a> and <a href="https://github.com/futureplatforms/Kirin">Kirin</a> allow codebases written in Javascript (and therefore anything that can be compiled to Javascript) to be manipulated from native code.  Disclaimer: I work for Future Platforms who created Kirin;  we have had great success using it on iOS with Javascript generated from Java with GWT, with  Java code also being run natively on Android.</p><p><strong>Use webviews...  where appropriate</strong></p><p>Full screen webviews have a lot of work to do to be able to imitate screen transitions and bounce effects.  But a webview inside native app chrome can be indistinguishable from native.</p><p>There are standard and well documented methods for native apps and webviews to communicate.</p><p>Lists and tables can work particularly well when done in this way, however text entry is an example of something best handled natively (for full control over keyboard).</p><h2>In summary</h2><p>The approach that&#39;s right for you depends on how complicated your app is, and what level of UI polish you&#39;ll be satisfied with.</p><p>My motto: <em>use webviews wherever you can, but make sure your users can&#39;t tell</em>.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
