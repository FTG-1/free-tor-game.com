I can see their point, but I have some problems with this when I try to follow the &#34;Three Laws of TDD&#34;, and use the &#34;Red &#8211; green &#8211; refactor&#34; cycle. I think it&#39;s best explained by an example:</p><p>Right now, I need a program that can read a file (containing tab-separated data) and filter out all columns that contain non-numerical data. I guess there&#39;s probably some simple tools available already to do this, but I decided to implement it from scratch myself, mostly because I figured it could be a nice and clean project for me to get some practice with TDD.</p><p>So, first, I &#34;put the red hat on&#34;, that is, I need a test that fails. I figured, I&#39;ll need a method that finds all the non-numerical fields in a line. So I write a simple test, of course it fails to compile immediately, so I start writing the function itself, and after a couple of cycles back and forth (red/green) I have a working function and a complete test.</p><p>Next, I continue with a function, &#34;gatherNonNumericColumns&#34; that reads the file, one line at a time, and calls my &#34;findNonNumericFields&#34;-function on each line to gather up all the columns that eventually must be removed. A couple of red-green-cycles, and I&#39;m done, having again, a working function and a complete test.</p><p>Now, I figure I should refactor. Since my method &#34;findNonNumericFields&#34; was designed only because I figured I would need it when implementing &#34;gatherNonNumericColumns&#34;, it seems to me that it would be reasonable to let &#34;findNonNumericFields&#34; become private. However, that would break my first tests, since they would no longer have access to the method they were testing.</p><p>So, I end up with a private methods, and a suite of test that test it. Since so many people advice that private methods should not be tested, it feels like I&#39;ve painted myself into a corner here. But where exactly did I fail?</p><p>I gather I could have started out at a higher level, writing a test that tests what will eventually become my public method (that is, findAndFilterOutAllNonNumericalColumns), but that feels somewhat counter to the whole point of TDD (at least according to Uncle Bob): That you should switch constantly between writing tests and production code, and that at any point in time, all your tests worked within the last minute or so. Because if I start out by writing a test for a public method, there will be several minutes (or hours, or even days in very complex cases) before I get all the details in the private methods to work so that the test testing the public method passes.</p><p>So, what to do? Is TDD (with the rapid red-green-refactor cycle) simply not compatible with private methods? Or is there a fault in my design?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><h2>Units</h2><p>I think I can pinpoint exactly where the problem started:</p><blockquote><p>I figured, I&#39;ll need a method that finds all the non-numerical fields in a line.</p></blockquote><p>This should be immediately followed with asking yourself &#34;Will that be a separate testable unit to <code>gatherNonNumericColumns</code> or part of the same one?&#34;</p><p>If the answer is &#34;<strong>yes, separate</strong>&#34;, then your course of action is simple: that method needs to be public on an appropriate class, so it can be tested as a unit. Your mentality is something like <em>&#34;I need to test drive out one method and I also need to test drive out another method&#34;</em></p><p>From what you say though, you figured that the answer is &#34;<strong>no, part of the same</strong>&#34;. At this point, your plan should no longer be to fully write and test <code>findNonNumericFields</code> <em>then</em> write <code>gatherNonNumericColumns</code>. Instead, it should be simply to write <code>gatherNonNumericColumns</code>. For now, <code>findNonNumericFields</code> should just be a likely part of the destination you have in mind when you&#39;re choosing your next red test case and doing your refactoring. This time your mentality is <em>&#34;I need to test drive out one method, and while I do so I should keep in mind that my finished implementation will probably include this other method&#34;.</em></p><hr/><h2>Keeping a short cycle</h2><p>Doing the above should <strong>not</strong> lead to the problems you describe in your penultimate paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>Because if I start out by writing a test for a public method, there will be several minutes (or hours, or even days in very complex cases) before I get all the details in the private methods to work so that the test testing the public method passes.</p></blockquote><p>At no point does this technique require you to write a red test which will only turn green when you implement the entirety of <code>findNonNumericFields</code> from scratch. Much more likely, <code>findNonNumericFields</code> will start as some code in-line in the public method you&#39;re testing, which will be built up over the course of several cycles and eventually extracted during a refactoring.</p><hr/><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>To give an approximate roadmap for this particular example, I don&#39;t know the exact test cases you used, but say you were writing <code>gatherNonNumericColumns</code> as your public method. Then most likely the test cases would be the same as the ones you wrote for <code>findNonNumericFields</code>, each one using a table with only one row. When that one-row scenario was fully implemented, and you wanted to write a test to force you to extract out the method, you&#39;d write a two-row case which would require you to add your iteration.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
