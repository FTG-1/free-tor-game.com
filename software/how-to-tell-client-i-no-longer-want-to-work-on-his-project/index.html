I wasn&#39;t given any details except for &#34;It has to be an XYZ plugin and interface with ABC product&#34;. Which was fine, but now we&#39;re towards the end (I think) and it&#39;s just dragging out. I don&#39;t have any time to spend on it and I&#39;m already over schedule by 3 months. Trying to get the client to describe to me how he would like to be able to navigate the data (a UI issue) is just difficult. I&#39;ve submitted mock ups on what I think he wants but his latest response is &#34;you should look at XXX product&#34;, it has similar functionality.</p><p>Of course, I looked at it and it looks similar to what I submitted, but I don&#39;t think that the way I&#39;ve built the framework is going to support what he is now describing to me. We&#39;ve had good communication throguh out the process but he doesn&#39;t know what he wants. I explained how I was going to build the framework and he agreed, so it isn&#39;t a bad choice on my part about design.</p><p>When I go over what I think are finalized modules, he says, &#34;You should have done it this way&#34; which requires me to go back and rework code and UI. Some smaller items could have been better thought out by me, but the big things are how I interpreted his requirements and I&#39;ve gone over this module several times during development.</p><p>I&#39;ve already received final funds last month so i&#39;m working for free at this point. I no longer want to deal with this project. I&#39;ve already received payment. I&#39;ve done other successful projects with this client before and he has a lot of other projects he wants to do.</p><p>What the heck should I do? I don&#39;t want to work on this project anymore. I don&#39;t want to ask for any more money (money isn&#39;t really the issue). I don&#39;t want to make him mad either. I know it looks like I want to have my cake and eat it too.</p><p>If you think I should call it quits, how should I do it given the circumstances?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>First, you need to get out of the mindset that you are now working for free, just because you&#39;ve gotten what you believe is the final payment. You agreed to a price and were paid.  If you had received all of the funds up front before even starting, would you have been doing the entire project for free?</p><p>(BTW this is why I never work on fixed-price projects; I always insist on working by the hour.)</p><p>If you can show that what the client has requested goes way beyond what you originally signed up for, then you could ask for more money, but as you indicated that doesn&#39;t seem to be the issue.  It sounds like you are just tired of the project.  Unfortunately that&#39;s not a good reason to quit.</p><p>If you had a defined specification at the beginning, and have met that spec, then you could ethically walk away from the project but you most certainly will never get any more work from this client again.  It would be better to finish up what the client wants, spending as little of your time as possible, and hope to do better next time.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
