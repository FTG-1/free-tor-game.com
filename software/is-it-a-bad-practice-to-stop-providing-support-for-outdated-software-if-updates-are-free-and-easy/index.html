If people are still using the version which was sold ten years ago, it means that they will find bugs which do not exist in next versions, their software may not work as expected on a new hardware or operating system, etc. The support people must also be trained to use this old version.</p><p>This is unavoidable in several cases:</p><ul><li><p>When every next version of the software is paid, you can&#39;t force everyone to spend their money every two years to buy the next version. Example: Microsoft has still to support Windows XP, since it is understandable that people don&#39;t want to pay hundreds of dollars for Windows Vista, then Seven, then Windows 8.</p></li><li><p>When the update is complicated. Example: when you know that installing SP2 of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 may render your server <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/299929/how-to-remove-a-broken-installation-of-sql-server-2008">completely unusable</a>, you may want to postpone installing updates and stay with and outdated version which has one strong point: it <em>works</em>.</p></li><li><p>When legacy systems or security considerations are involved. Example: auto-updating a space shuttle software every week may have some disadvantages. In the same way, you can&#39;t update hardware if the legacy software requires the old hardware to run.</p></li></ul><p>Now, let&#39;s say that the update process is as well done as in Google Chrome. The user doesn&#39;t have to bother with the updates; there are no security or legacy reasons to not to update, and the updates are free.</p><p>In this case, is it a bad practice, for a company, to stop providing any support for the versions outdated for a few months, and ask their customers to update their software first, then contacting the support if the problem persists?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>If you set up the problem in the way you do by explicitly saying that there are no legacy reasons not to upgrade, everyone is going to agree that there is no reason to support older versions.  Eliminating legacy reasons not to upgrade, however, is much easier said than done.</p><p>Does the new version make any change to the UI?  If so, that may mean that the screen shots and screen recordings that a company has put together to show users how to perform a particular task need to be re-recorded.  That may mean that users have to spend some time adjusting to the new UI in order to do the same things they&#39;ve always done.</p><p>Can you really guarantee that upgrades are risk-free?  You use the example of the SQL Server 2008 SP2 installer causing the server to become unusable.  Microsoft spent a lot more time and money testing the SP2 installer than most companies can afford to spend testing every possible configuration that might affect the installer.  SQL Server is an enterprise product so there is, generally, less variability in what people have installed on their servers than there is when you look at consumer boxes.  And there is a ton of time between SQL Server service packs so there is little rush to get software out the door.  And yet, in your example, Microsoft still failed to deliver.  That should demonstrate how difficult it is to ship a 100% risk-free upgrade even if everything lines up in your favor.  And even if you could deliver a completely 100% risk-free upgrade, how does your customer know that your upgrades, unlike every other upgrade they have to deal with, are risk-free?</p><p>Does the new version make any changes to existing functionality?  Even if you&#39;re just fixing a bug, once you have enough customers, it&#39;s likely that someone somewhere will depend on that buggy behavior.  Think of all the sites, for example, that have been optimized for some version of some browser that don&#39;t work or look terrible when the bugs in the old browser&#39;s handling of some HTML element are fixed.</p><p>If you recognize that there are valid legacy reasons not to upgrade, you&#39;re well within your rights to make a policy decision that ease of maintenance and streamlining support outweighs the legacy needs of customers.  Whether that is the right decision will, of course, depend on how large the legacy problems are and how costly it is to support old versions. But you&#39;re much more likely to make the right trade-off if you approach the problem by assuming that there are many sources of legitimate legacy issues and figuring out how to quantify those issues than if you start from the assumption that there are no legacy issues.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
