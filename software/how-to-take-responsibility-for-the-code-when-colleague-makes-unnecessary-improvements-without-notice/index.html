So sometimes he reviews my changes before they complete the end goal and makes changes right away&#8230; and has even broken my work once.</p><p>Other times, he has made unnecessary improvements to some of my code that is 3+ months old.</p><p>This annoys me for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>I am not always given a chance to fix my mistakes</li><li>He has not taken the time to ask me what I was trying to accomplish when he is confused, which could affect his testing or changes</li><li>I don&#39;t always think his code is readable</li><li>Deadlines are not an issue and his current workload doesn&#39;t require any work in my projects other than reviewing my code changes.</li></ol><p>Anyways, I have told him in the past to please keep me posted if he sees something in my work that he wants to change so that I could take ownership of my code (maybe I should have said &#34;shortcomings&#34;) and he&#39;s not been responsive.</p><p>I fear that I may come off as aggressive when I ask him to explain his changes to me.</p><p>He&#39;s just a quiet person who keeps to himself, but his actions continue. I don&#39;t want to banish him from making code changes (not like I could), because we are a team&#8211;but I want to do my part to help our team.</p><p>Added clarifications:</p><ul><li>We share 1 development branch. I do not wait until all my changes complete a single task because I risk losing some significant work&#8211;so I make sure my changes build and do not break anything.</li><li>My concern is that my teammate doesn&#39;t explain the reason or purpose behind his changes. I don&#39;t think he should need my blessing, but if we disagree on an approach I thought it would be best to discuss the pros and cons and make a decision once we both understand what is going on.</li><li>I have not discussed this with our team lead yet as I would prefer to resolve personal disagreements without getting management involved unless it is necessary. Since my concern seemed more of personal issue than a threat to our work, I chose to not bother the team lead. I am working on code review process ideas&#8211;to help promote the benefits of more organized code reviews without making it all about my pet peeves.</li></ul></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>I think most developers find themselves in this position at some point, and I hope that every developer who&#39;s felt victimized realizes how frustrating it will be when he or she becomes the senior and feels compelled to clean up code written by juniors.</p><p>For me, avoiding conflict in this situation comes down to two things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Courtesy</strong>. Talking to someone about his/her code allows a dev to know that you&#39;re interested and you can discuss it as grown up professionals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forget about &#34;code ownership&#34; - the team owns the code</strong>. Other people wanting to make the changes is a good thing. If a senior dev makes changes that are &#34;unreadable&#34; or worse, then back them out. You don&#39;t need to be aggressive, just let an editor know that his/her changes didn&#39;t work, and you&#39;re more than happy to discuss your reversion.</p></li></ol><p>Remember, team ownership of code is great and it cuts both ways. If you see something that doesn&#39;t make sense in someone else&#39;s code, then fix it. Being overly possessive and inadequately communicative is a surefire way to a create a poisonous development environment.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
