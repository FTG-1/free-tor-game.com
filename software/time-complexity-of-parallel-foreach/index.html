That is, even the most complex (in terms of time complexity) algorithms can be solved very fast for adequately small inputs!</p></li><li><p>Your proposed code will not be <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>^3) complexity, rather <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>*<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>), because, in all likelihood, you don&#39;t have equal numbers of companies, employees per company and items per employee (i.e. <em>n</em> companies, <em>m</em> employees per company and <em>k</em> items per employee).</p></li><li><p>Yes, you can think of each nested loop like a multiplication in terms of Big-O notation. For each outer item <em>i</em> out of <em>k</em>, you must perform a multiple of, say, <em>m</em> actions. So for each <strong>additional</strong> outer item, it&#39;s another <em>m</em> actions. <strong>Note</strong> however, that if you have other things going on inside your loops (e.g. early stopping, etc.), time complexity may change.</p></li><li><p>Because of 1, <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> will not change the time complexity. However, it will certainly lower the overall time. A <strong>simplified</strong> way to think of this is a factor, out of whatever is inside the parentheses, e.g. think of <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>*<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>) as an <em>alias</em> for <em>t</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>k</em>) = <em>a</em>*(<em>n</em>*<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>) (<em>t</em> meaning actual time). Increasing or decreasing the constant <em><strong>a</strong></em> will <strong>obviously</strong> have an impact on the total running time of the algorithm. So, using <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> will have more of an effect on that constant, but the time complexity will not change (i.e. the time growth in input will increase approximately as it would without <code>Parallel.ForEach</code>). Let alone <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> depends on the actual hardware that is available, therefore, it is case-specific. As a result, in certain cases, you may end up <em>delaying</em> your run-time instead of speeding it up.</p></li></ol><p>In simple words, <em>if all companies have the same number of employees and each employee the same number of items</em>, then <strong>triple</strong> the number of companies will <strong>triple</strong> the total running time (approximately, of course, and always given that you don&#39;t do any &#34;tricks&#34; inside the loops, which may depend on the company), with or without <code>Parallel.ForEach</code>, and this is what Big-O notation expresses.</p><p>*Once again, note that point 4 above is a <em>simplification</em>, just for the purpose of illustration. Things are much more complicated and, in reality, run-time analysis involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">multiple tests</a> against various input sizes <strong>and</strong> distributions.</p><h1>Update</h1><p>To provide a more direct answer to the question, let&#39;s reference a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_random-access_machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">parallel vector model of computation</a>. The <em>step complexity</em> is a theoretical measure that assumes using the ideal case of a processing device with infinite processors. This is done to &#34;abstract&#34; the complication of restricting the length of an input vector, in order to focus on the &#34;parallelizability&#34; of a problem. As a result, if a process can be broken down in steps, which can be executed in parallel, the <strong>step complexity</strong> is the time complexity of each such step. Of course, a problem may have more than one ways to be split in parallel steps. Minimizing this step complexity is important on its own. The point is that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms#Execution_on_a_limited_number_of_processors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the real world</a> (see <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdeep/courses_iitkgp/PAlgo/Autumn16-17/slides/Lect5Brent.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for some further analysis):</p><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/15b6adcc79c3affbc7dd1fd69cf37039e4665104" alt=""/>,</p><p>where <em>N</em> &gt; <em>p</em> and <em>p</em> is the count of processors you are considering. Considering <em>N</em> = ∞, to relate to the aforementioned cases, this reads something along the lines: the total running time for <em>p</em> processors is bounded by the step complexity, plus the total work (sometimes called <em>work complexity</em>, i.e. the total work if the algorithm ran sequentially in 1 processor) divided by the number of processors. What this means (well, <em>in very simple words</em>) is that you get, at most, a p-fold improvement, minus something that depends on how well you designed your algorithm (of course, this is an upper bound, in the real-world, mixed results are observed, which some times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedup#Super-linear_speedup" rel="nofollow noreferrer">appear to conflict with theory</a>). The important thing here is that the p-fold improvement dominates the complexity as <em>p</em> gets smaller (i.e. as reality gets more relevant).</p><p>The take-home point, however, is that this &#34;p-fold improvement&#34; scales based on <em>the number of processors</em> and <strong>not</strong> on <em>the size of the input</em>! If you are a general-purpose algorithm designer, you usually have little control on <em>p</em>. What you have control over is typically <strong>T_1</strong>, i.e. you can employ algorithms that are as efficient as possible <strong>sequentially</strong>, to begin with.</p><p>Optimizing an algorithm for parallel execution is a very complicated task and, unless the requirements and use case are explicitly such, and adequately backed up, so that you <strong>absolutely must</strong> sit down and thoroughly analyze your algorithm, the most you can expect to get from <code>Parallel.ForEach</code> is something slightly worse than this p-fold improvement (and often, quite a bit of trouble debugging). Note that when <em>p</em> = 1, it is not unexpected to get increased run-time.</p><h1>Additional Comments</h1><p>Some additional points, in order to address some of the comments, as the original example is probably overly simplified.</p><ol start="5"><li><p>Big-O notation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Formal_definition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mathematical &#34;artifact&#34;</a>. The use of the definition in the context of computational complexity requires a certain degree of &#34;abuse&#34;, in order to be useful. For example, if <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = x^3 + 5x, then <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>O</em>(<em>x</em>^3), but <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>O</em>(<em>x</em>^15) is just as correct from a mathematical perspective. Even the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Equals_sign" rel="nofollow noreferrer">equals sign</a> is not <em>strictly</em> OK.</p></li><li><p><strong>Context is important</strong>. That means that the function <em>f</em> <strong>and</strong> the variable <em>x</em> can mean anything. Big-O simply expresses an asymptotic upper bound. In most contexts, the tightest known bound is typically used, because it conveys the most useful information. But Big-O stops right there. Further interpretation is based on what function <em>f</em> means in the desired context.</p></li><li><p>Analyzing the <strong>same</strong> algorithm can end up producing different <strong>expressions</strong> of complexity. It all depends on <strong>the definition of the problem size</strong>. For example, consider <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1870336/what-is-the-complexity-of-matrix-addition"><strong>square</strong> Matrix addition</a>. It is equally valid to say that the time complexity is <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>) or <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>^2). The key is that these statements consider a different <strong>size measure</strong> for the problem. If one cares about total elements <em>N</em>, then yes, square matrix addition scales <strong>no worse than linearly</strong> (this is <em>precisely</em> what Big O states) with respect to total elements <em>N</em>. In an obscurely <strong>equivalent</strong> manner, square matrix addition scales <strong>no worse than quadratically</strong> with respect to row (or column) count <em>n</em>. <strong>3x</strong> the rows (and columns, as the matrices are square) ends up taking &lt;= <strong>9x</strong> the time, since total elements are now (3n)x(3n) = 9(n^2).</p></li><li><p>How is this relevant to the question? Well, one of the <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/400932/time-complexity-of-parallel-foreach/400933?noredirect=1#comment882064_400933">comments</a> indicates that to arrive at an <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>*<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>) complexity for the OP&#39;s code, certain <strong>important</strong> assumptions have to be made. In order to clarify some intricate points, consider the following scenarios:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-parallel computation</strong> with <em>n</em> indicating total number of companies, <em>m</em> indicating total number of employees per <strong>each and every</strong> company, and <em>k</em> items per <strong>each and every</strong> employee, with no employee belonging to more than 1 company and no item belonging to more than 1 employee. What <strong>matters</strong> in this scenario, is that the computation involves <em>n</em> iterations, of <em>m</em> iterations, of <em>k</em> iterations (as in a 3-dimensional matrix) and the time complexity is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>*<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>). Alternatively, if <em>q</em> is the overall total number of items, the time complexity is <em>O</em>(<em>q</em>). Facts of life, such as employees working in more than one company or items belonging to multiple employees <strong>do</strong> change the complexity. Also, in real-world input, there is no <em>m</em> variable, or <em>k</em> variable because these represent per-company/employee counts, not overall counts.</p></li><li><p>Considering more realistic conditions: Employees can only work in 1 company but items are definitely accessible from more than 1 employee (i.e. considering domain implications). In that case, things are slightly more complicated. Consider a <strong>total</strong> of <em>n</em> companies, a <strong>total</strong> of <em>m</em> employees (of all companies) and a <strong>total</strong> of <em>k</em> items (from all companies). In the worst case, all employees can access all items at all companies. In that case, m_i * k_i iterations would have to be performed for each company <em>i</em> (considering m_i representing the total number of employees and k_i representing total items for company i. Now, <strong>regardless of how many the companies are</strong>, <em>m</em> * <em>k</em> = (m_1 + m_2 + ... m_n) * (k_1 + k_2 + ... k_n)  &gt;=  m_1 * k_1 + m_2 * k_2 + ... + m_n * k_n. In short, as the number of companies, <em>n</em>, grows, the worst case is that <strong>each employee accesses all items of their company</strong>. As a result, under the given assumptions, the time complexity is <em>O</em>(<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>), i.e. the triple loop would not scale worse than an equivalent double loop running over all employees and all items. In &#34;domain words&#34;, your algorithm will always run faster than the equivalent &#34;flattened down&#34; case (i.e. if all your employees and items belonged to 1 company).</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>An important note for the last point, above, is that O(<em>m</em>*<em>k</em>) is just <strong>one</strong> asymptotic upper bound. It may not be the <strong>tightest known</strong>, i.e. an actual programmed solution may scale far better than that. A tighter bound may exist, but, of course, determining it would require further analysis of all conditions involved in the algorithmic procedure, alternative calculation paths etc.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
