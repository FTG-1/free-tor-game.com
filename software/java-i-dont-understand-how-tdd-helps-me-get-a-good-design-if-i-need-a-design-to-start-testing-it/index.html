I&#39;ve looked at some books, but the ones I found mainly tackle the testing part &#8211; the History of NUnit, why testing is good, Red/Green/Refactor and how to create a String Calculator.</p><p>Good stuff, but that&#39;s &#34;just&#34; Unit Testing, not TDD. Specifically, I don&#39;t understand how TDD helps me get a good design if I need a Design to start testing it.</p><p>To illustrate, imagine these 3 requirements:</p><ul><li>A catalog needs to have a list of products</li><li>The catalog should remember which products a user viewed</li><li>Users should be able to search for a product</li></ul><p>At this points, many books pull a magic rabbit out of a hat and just dive into &#34;Testing the ProductService&#34;, but they don&#39;t explain how they came to the conclusion that there is a ProductService in the first place. That is the &#34;Development&#34; part in TDD that I&#39;m trying to understand.</p><p>There needs to be an existing design, but stuff outside of entity-services (that is: There is a Product, so there should be a ProductService) is nowhere to be found (e.g., the second requirement requires me to have some concept of a User, but where would I put the functionality to remind? And is Search a feature of the ProductService or a separate SearchService? How would I know which I should choose?)</p><p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a>, I would need a UserService, but if I design a system without TDD, I might end up with a whole bunch of Single-Method Services. Isn&#39;t TDD intended to make me discover my design in the first place?</p><p>I&#39;m a .net developer, but Java resources would also work. I feel that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a real sample application or book that deals with a real line of business application.  Can someone provide a clear example that illustrates the process of creating a design using TDD?</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>The idea of TDD is to start with testing and work from that.  Thus, to take your example of &#34;A catalog needs to have a list of products&#34; could be seen as having a test of &#34;Check for products in catalog&#34; and thus this is the first test.  Now, what holds a catalog?  What holds a product?  Those are the next pieces and the idea is to get some bits and pieces put together that would be something like a ProductService that will be born from getting that first test to pass.</p><p>The idea of TDD is to start with a test and then write the code that makes that test pass as the first point.  Unit tests are part of this yes, but you aren&#39;t looking at the overall picture that is formed by starting with tests and then writing the code so that there aren&#39;t blind spots at this point since there isn&#39;t any code yet.</p><hr/><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Skud/test-driven-development-tutorial">Test Driven Development Tutorial</a> where slides 20-22 are the key ones.  The idea is to know what the functionality should do as a result, write a test for it and then build a solution.  The design part will vary as depending on what is required it may or may not be that simple to do.  A key point is to use TDD from the start rather than try to introduce late into a project.  If you start with tests first this can help and is likely worth noting in a sense.  If you try to add the tests later, it becomes something that may be put off or delayed.  The later slides may also be useful as well.</p><hr/><p>A main benefit of TDD is that by starting with the tests, you aren&#39;t locked into a design initially.  Thus, the idea is to build the tests and create the code that will pass those tests as a development methodology.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">Big Design Up Front</a> can cause problems as this gives the idea of locking things into place which makes the system being built to be less nimble in the end.</p><hr/><p>Robert Harvey added this in the comments which is worth stating in the answer:</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately I think that this is a common misconception about TDD: <em>you can&#39;t grow a software architecture by just writing unit tests and making them pass.</em> Writing unit tests does influence the design, but
 it doesn&#39;t <em>create</em> the design. You have to do that.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
