By this, I mean that us developers can&#39;t rework the business side of the app. The main goal is to be able to translate same processes into web application.</p><p>Business layer of the older version is not directly reusable, since it&#39;s really GUI-dependent. Those business process were rewritten as UML diagrams, which will be used as support for us to develop the new app.</p><p>The problem I meet is that I don&#39;t know how to deal with process that need user interactions. For example :</p><p>On validation of a sale order, the validation process checks all products it contains, verifying if there is available stock, and then perform different operations. If there is no stock available, the user is asked if he wants to cancel the order, remove this product or select another one equivalent. It works like a Javascript <code>alert</code> or <code>confirm</code> : current &#34;thread&#34; (ie validation process) is on hold, waiting for user interaction. After user&#39;s choice, it finishes dealing with the current product, and then validates the next one, and so on.</p><p>How to deal with this kind of processes with a web application ? Is there some framework, design pattern or something else that permits to write this kind of business processes, able to start and hold like that ?</p><p>A solution could be to split those business processes into smaller ones. For my example, we would have 2 sub-processes : the first one checks all products and flags the problematic ones. Then the user has a screen to decide what to do on flagged products, and validates. At this moment we are sure all products are OK, we can start the second sub-process to perform the others operations.</p><p>The problem with it is that even if it&#39;s pretty simple on this example, it can be really more complicated. Some process have a lot of users interactions like this one, and then could be splitted into 10 subparts. Like I earlier precised, we don&#39;t want to modify or rethink business process, to be sure that we lose nothing or introduce new business bugs.</p><p>Does someone has an experience about it ? Do you know some way to deal with this kind of desktop-to-web developments ?</p><hr/><p><strong>EDIT 15/07/14</strong></p><p>There was some misunderstanding about this post, surely related to my poor english expression and vocabulary.</p><p>To summarize the problem :</p><p>I got a bunch of business workflows described into UML diagrams. They comes from a huge 30-year-old CAMM (production management ERP). The project is to redevelop this application under <strong>Java</strong> web environment.<br /> The main point is that some of those workflows are user-dependent, since, in the middle of the processing, they need a user-interaction. Because web applications are based on a client-server architecture, I don&#39;t know how to port them.<br /> Reworking/rethinking these workflows is not an option, because it would be too much time-consuming. I need a way to simulate a desktop application on a web app, like <a href="http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt" rel="noreferrer">Wt</a>, but for Java (i&#39;m not talking about UI but about how to develop workflows ), or to define rules to make those user-dependent workflows web-compatibles.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Your primary difficulties I feel are that you have a mismatch between a very linear and custom workflow in an older application that do not coincide with the user interaction workflows that are common on the web.</p><p>Web applications that interact with a server application that contain the business logic communicate in a Request/Response messaging style.  The client browser and the server running an application that has the business logic are separate processes.  The client requests a resource (html page, jpg image, JSON data, etc...) and the server provides that resource in an inherently <strong>stateless</strong> way.  This is a much different paradigm from your self contained desktop application that has a concept of global state for a users session.  The users session in a desktop application lives and dies by the running process on the workstation.</p><p>So basically there are two ways you can handle the maintenance of state in a web application that always has a client/server relationship.</p><h2>Server Centric</h2><p>A server centric web application will maintain stateful information for an individual user&#39;s session.  They do this typically by serving a session cookie once the user is authenticated.  The client application (browser) will include its unique session token with each request which allows the server to retrieve stateful information about the clients state from the last time they received a request for this client.</p><p>Further the server will contain most if not all of the business logic behind performing actions that the typical business user will want to achieve, actions that have real business value.  This is not to be confused with <strong>presentation logic</strong> which is most client side code (Eg. Javascript) that performs user interface interaction like hiding a particular menu in a form if a specific checkbox has been checked.</p><h2>Client Centric</h2><p>While you might have a server to maintain authentication of a user and maintaing an active session, you could use a client side scripting framework (Eg. Javascript framework like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> to perform most if not all of the business logic operations and presentation logic operations.  The advantages of this model are that you can program your web application in much the same way as one might program a desktop application.  Client state will live and die by the browser navigation to the current page in much the same way that it will live and die on the running process of a desktop application.  For communication with a database you can expose stateless webservices on the server that can proxy for a database.</p><p>Some important considerations with this approach are that users on client browsers have the ability to modify or change how Javascript can behave which might be potentially dangerous and introduce unknown exception cases to your application.  It is highly recommended that if this approach is taken that great care should be taken on interactions with servers to sanitize inputs and validate all data going back and forth.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, the application you specified is very old. It sounds like you are making the right choice in capturing the current workflows and trying to assess what the user needs are.  The next step would be to try and follow Agile principles and capture business value in user stories.  I would start on clean slate and try to discover other means and workflows that can also attain the same business value captured in the user stories.  This application is so old that it was likely limited by the technology of its day to where technical constraints influenced the user workflows in a negative or archaic way.  Basically there are probably better ways, more intuitive workflows and user interfaces that the business can use that will also achieve the same end goals.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
