Now I am trying to choose the technology to connect the android devices to the server. The clients run on Android, and the game is MMORPG. I would like to write the server in java. Right now I have only 3 ideas for it:</p><p><em><strong>1) creating multithreading environment with plain java and sockets. In this way it will be easier to perform full-duplex connection between the game client and the server. But I have the following concerns:</strong></em></p><p>1.1) The game is MMORPG with a large number of objects, and I am not sure how such solutions are scaled if there are for example 5000 people playing at the same time. How many threads will I be able to run on java Machine? How can I approximately calculate that? In case 1 thread is reading for each socket and 1 thread is writing to the socket (so 2 threads for 1 player).</p><p>1.2) When the number of players grows, how will I be able to scale my self-written jar-archive to distribute over several servers? Maybe there is some special trick to do that?</p><p>1.3) A lot of programming overhead &#8211; sockets API is quite low level.</p><p><em><strong>2) Creating a Servlet-interface for serving HTTP requests.</strong></em></p><p>2.1) Easy to control sessions (and authorization) as long as each player has his/her own session.</p><p>2.2) can connect to java EE EJB or whatever &#8211; a lot of complications with system-level programming are taken away. So I can concentrate on writing business logic.</p><p>2.3) Can serve all types of clients with HTTP &#8211; mobile devices + browsers.</p><p>2.4) High-speed &#8211; even 1 servlet container can serve a few thousand requests per second so it will be really fast.</p><p>2.4) But this approach cant provide a full-duplex communication. I will have to send requests every 1 second to check for updates. 1 second delay does not make a lot of difference for the game as it is turn-based, but still it generates a lot of traffic. Is it feasible when there are many players playing? I heard about some COMET technology, but it seems like if the server has to push many messages in row, I will still have to send requests every time + this technology is not well established yet.</p><p><em><strong>3) Creating sockets and connecting them through JMS to the java EE server.</strong></em></p><p>3.1) Cool because allows for full duplex communication between clients and server + provides all cool features of java EE. Later can be extended to browser through servlet interface.</p><p>3.2) It seems like some kind of overengineering. Is it really how people would do that? I mean is it even the correct way? Would any sane developer do it like that?</p><p>I would like you to help me out with the choice please. I dont have much experience with doing some work like that. And would like to stick to the best practices.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><h1>Why Rewrite What you can Get Off the Shelf?</h1><p>Why not use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedDwarf_Server">RedDwarf Server</a> (formerly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Darkstar">Project DarkStar</a>)?</p><blockquote><p>RedDwarf Server is an open source middleware solution for developing the server-side of massively multiplayer online games. It is the official community fork of Project Darkstar, an open source project supported and managed by Sun Microsystems. - <em>from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedDwarf_Server">RedDwarf&#39;s Wikipedia article</a></em></p></blockquote><p>RedDwarf&#39;s domain seems down today (2013-06-12), but there&#39;s still a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/reddwarf/">wiki</a>, and they are migrating to a <a href="https://github.com/reddwarf-nextgen/reddwarf">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>RedDward presents its philosophy and goals as:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Make server-side game code reliable, scalable, persistent, and fault-tolerant in a manner that is transparent to the game developer.</li><li>Present a simple single-threaded event-driven programming model to the developer. The developer should never have his or her code fail due to interactions between code handling different events. <em>(from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/reddwarf/raw-attachment/wiki/Documentation/RedDwarf ServerAppTutorial.odt">RedDwarf Tutorial</a>)</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Not that this doesn&#39;t mean that server-code is single-threaded, but that it is abstracted from the game developer&#39;s perspective. The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/reddwarf/raw-attachment/wiki/Documentation/RedDwarf ServerAppTutorial.odt">RedDwarf Tutorial</a> provides a lot more information on what RedDwarf can do and clarifies many of its design decisions.</p><p>One point of concern for you, though, was that the multi-node capability wasn&#39;t fully implemented last time I check (ca. 2011).</p><h1>From Scratch</h1><p>That shouldn&#39;t stop you from attempting to do most of these things from scratch, if you value the learning experience. However, this is a major effort and will be rather time-consuming, and as, you noted in your question, some of these issues are rather low-level in the tech stack to deal with and will greatly increase the complexity of the code you&#39;ll have to maintain.</p><p>But anyways, regarding your 3 options, your first one seems the best to me, if you were to go for a home-made implementation. Option 2 (using HTTP servlets) seems only adapted for some games, though I guess it could be a relatively decent alternative to implement something yourself while still delegating to the a middleware, and you could benefit from many web server additions for handling the load (cache modules, etc...). Option 3 (using JMS + JEE) indeed seems overengineered, but it&#39;s hard to know for sure without knowing what you have in mind.</p><p>And if you&#39;re here to try to learn, then obviously Option 1 will cover a lot of ground. But it&#39;s going to be a rather uphill battle.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
