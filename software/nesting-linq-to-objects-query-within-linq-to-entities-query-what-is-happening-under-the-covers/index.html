</code></pre><p>Based on this, is it possible that Linq2Entities provider indeed doesn&#39;t execute non-Linq and Linq-to-Object methods, but instead creates equivalent SQL statements for some of them ( and for others it throws an exception )?</p><p>Thank you in advance</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>Presumably the data provider looks at each sub-expression and if it can be computed it just does a compile and execute while it&#39;s constructing the query.  This would be no different than saying:</p><pre><code>where c.ContactID == (4 + 5)
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s because <code>numbers</code> in your example is an <code>int[]</code> type.</p><p>Interestingly this is only evaluated once before the query is generated, so it&#39;s only calculated once.  If you did something like this:</p><pre><code>where c.ContactID == myObject.NextID()
</code></pre><p>...then it evaluates <code>myObject.NextID()</code> during the construction of the query, so it only calls it once.  I have witnessed, in Linq2NHibernate, that not only does it only call it once during the creating of the query, but the data provider has built-in query caching, and <em>it won&#39;t re-evaluate it the next time you execute the same query</em>.  YMMV.</p><p>Also remember it&#39;s lazy evaluated, so if you never execute the query, the subexpression is never compiled and executed.  Also, if you modify <code>numbers</code> after your statement but before executing the <code>foreach</code> then the query will be built using your modified value.</p><hr/><p><strong>Edit:</strong></p><p>Here&#39;s an article called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb546158.aspx" rel="nofollow">Walkthrough: Creating an IQueryable LINQ Provider</a>.

/// be part of an evaluated sub-tree. 
/// &lt;/summary&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Basically it&#39;s searching the expression tree for anything that can be evaluated, and compiling and executing it, then replacing that sub-expression with a constant expression.</p><p>Here&#39;s the function that determines if an expression can be evaluated:</p><pre><code>private static bool CanBeEvaluatedLocally(Expression expression)
{
    return expression.NodeType != ExpressionType.Parameter;
}
</code></pre><p>So as long as no sub-expression contains a parameter of the expression, then it can be evaluated.</p><hr/><p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p><p>Based on your edit, it <em>does</em> look like it&#39;s putting the values from the array into a table in SQL and selecting <code>MAX</code> from that.  I honestly have no idea why it would bother doing that when none of the elements of the sub-expression <code>numbers.Max()</code> are parameters.  I certainly know that you can write an expression like <code>numbers.Contains(c.ID)</code> and that will actually create an <code>IN</code> clause such as <code>c.ID IN (@p0, @p1, @p2, @p3, @p4)</code> where <code>@p0 = 1</code>, <code>@p1 = 2</code>, etc.</p><p>So, to answer your question: &#34;is it possible that Linq2Entities provider indeed doesn&#39;t execute non-Linq and Linq-to-Object methods, but instead creates equivalent SQL statements for some of them&#34;</p><p>Yes, it&#39;s possible.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
