This seems like a hack, and I&#39;m forever finding bugs from junior devs that trip over this issue.</p><p>Time is always relative to a fixed point. 4PM is 4 hours post meridian, or noon. The sun&#39;s highest point in transit is observable, and allows us to set up a coordinate system. 3 hours before noon (Ante Meridian), 2 hours after noon, 1441899402938 milliseconds since January 1, 1970. To people raised in a Cartesian world, this is second nature.</p><p>But our Calendar predates Descartes. My argument is that it is more properly thought of as a enumeration over which a modulo function is applied. Monday follows Sunday, and so on until you get to the fact that Sunday follows Saturday. There is no positive and negative, it is a modulus, or absolute value.</p><p>Similarly with years repeating. Every 365 days (or so) there are several special days for me: birthdays, anniversaries, childrens&#39; birthdays, etc. etc. Business scheduling applications are rife with examples of meetings every seven days, first Tuesday of the month, etc. Just because we CAN map this onto a floating point number, and in truth mapping it onto said number solves a LOT of problems that are really difficult the old way, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only way to do it.</p><p>Awareness and understanding of the &#34;square peg in a round hole&#34; nature of using DateTimes to store Dates makes you a better programmer in my opinion.</p><p>Is there value in an application explicitly intended as a scheduling application in defining a Date class, or is &#34;set all times to noon&#34; the best approach? What issues might there be with using DateTime and setting the Time component to Noon?  Can timezone shifting be accounted for in such an approach? I&#39;ve used MomentJS, but I think that&#39;s just a better Date class.</p></div>     <div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="mt-3 border-bottom border-success"><h4 class="text-success"><i class='fa fa-check-circle text-success mr-3'></i><span>Best Answer</span></h4></div><div class='bg-transparent mb-3'><p>First of all, let&#39;s get one thing out of the way: <strong>birthdays</strong> are one thing, <strong>dates-of-birth</strong> are another.  A <em>Birthday</em> is an exotic data type because it lacks not only the components of hours, minutes etc but it also lacks the year component. If you really want to deal with birthdays, I would recommend inventing your own data type which contains nothing but a month number and a day number, and is not related to any of the built-in date-time data types.</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to also keep track of the year of birth, then what you have is not birthdays, it is <em>dates-of-birth</em>. So, the question now becomes why is there no date-only data type, so that you can conveniently represent dates-of-birth, and instead popular languages seem to force you to use some type that also includes a time component.</p><p>Let me briefly mention that it is not true that <em>all</em> programming languages only offer temporal data types which include a time component.  I have come across date-only data types in RDBMSes and in their corresponding SQL dialects. But that&#39;s irrelevant: the fact that these data types exist does not mean that they are a good thing to have, and RDBMSes have a long history of confusing storage with representation.</p><p>You will understand why it is a bad idea to have such date-only data types the moment you realize that time is a coordinate.  Most people have a very vague idea of what time is, and this idea contains arcane cultural notions such as years, months and days, without realizing that these notions are exclusively <em>representational</em>: They are only useful for representing time to a human, and to receive time as input from a human.  At any layer below the actual time-entry GUI control, time should be, and usually is, represented as a time coordinate, which is a single number of time units since some origin.</p><p>For example, in the <code>DateTime</code> data type of Microsoft Dotnet, the time unit is 100 nanoseconds, and the origin of time is 12:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 C.E.</p><p>Another example of an arcane, exclusively representational notation is angle measurements using degrees, minutes of a degree, and seconds of a degree. Of course, in order to get any useful calculation done, you have to internally use radians, and if need be, convert to and from degrees when interacting with a human user.</p><p>So, do not confuse the human-readable representation of a measurement with the actual nature of the measurement.  Quite often the ideal method for realizing a measurement, which most closely matches the nature of the measurement, is very different from the human-readable representation of that measurement.</p><p>In light of all this, your request for a temporal data type that represents only dates is akin to a request for an angular data type that would only be capable of representing degrees, explicitly preventing any greater precision. Such a data type would be quite limited, and ultimately useless, because you would have to convert it to and from radians anyway in order to get anything useful done with it.</p><p>Your problem with the date-of-birth is that you have an <em>imprecise</em> time coordinate: the person was, of course, born at a specific moment in time, but the hour and minute were either not recorded by the hospital, or we do not care about them. So, what is <em>really</em> happening is that your date-and-time-of-birth time coordinate has a margin of error, a <em>tolerance</em> or <em>uncertainty</em> if you wish, and it is best to treat it as such: put it at exactly the middle of the day, and consider an implied +12 -12 hour uncertainty.  And that&#39;s precisely the solution that you have intuitively arrived to.</p></div></div><div class="col-4"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-4"> <ins class="adsbygoogle"
